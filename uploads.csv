2,__label1__,Lithium batteries are something new introduced in the market there average developing cost is relatively high but Stallion doesn't compromise on quality and provides us with the best at a low cost.<br />There are so many in built technical assistants that act like a sensor in their particular forté. The battery keeps my phone charged up and it works at every voltage and a high voltage is never risked.
3,__label1__,"I purchased this swing for my baby. She is 6 months now and has pretty much out grown it. It is very loud and doesn't swing very well. It is beautiful though. I love the colors and it has a lot of settings, but I don't think it was worth the money."
4,__label1__,I was looking for an inexpensive desk calcolatur and here it is. It works and does everything I need. Only issue is that it tilts slightly to one side so when I hit any keys it rocks a little bit. Not a big deal.
5,__label1__,"I only use it twice a week and the results are great. I have used other teeth whitening solutions and most of them, for the same results I would have to use it at least three times a week. Will keep using this because of the potency of the solution and also the technique of the trays, it keeps everything in my teeth, in my mouth."
6,__label1__,I'm not sure what this is supposed to be but I would recommend that you do a little more research into the culture of using pipes if you plan on giving this as a gift or using it yourself.
7,__label1__,"Pleased with ping pong table. 11 year old and 13 year old having a blast, plus lots of family entertainment too. Plus better than kids sitting on video games all day. A friend put it together. I do believe that was a challenge, but nothing they could not handle"
8,__label1__,"Great vitamin C serum... I really like the oil feeling, not too sticky. I used it last week on some of my recent bug bites and it helps heal the skin faster than normal."
9,__label1__,"I've used tide pods laundry detergent for many years,its such a great detergent to use having a nice scent and leaver the cloths smelling fresh."
10,__label1__,"Everybody wants to fall for their promises. But this is a relatively unheard of brand, some even say a non existant company. Look at how amateur their labels and products are. You have to ask yourself if you would trust this kind of amateur stuff? No way! Don't waste your money."
11,__label1__,Unfortunately they didn't work for me. They made me sick and throw up once of the two times I tried them
12,__label1__,"This kettle is a gift for my daughter. She said that it is easy to use. She likes the design of it, so nice and neat."
13,__label1__,"I love this tumbler! Keeps drinks warm or cold for a good period of time, and its very sturdy. I get complements on how sleek it looks all the time, especially because it doesnt leave fingerprints. Highly recommend. Only suggestion when washing the lid, be sure to shake it and dry well to prevent dripping when the lid is on the tumbler."
14,__label1__,"Only giving this 3 stars because it is so cheap. Has a very mild sedative effect, other than that it's pretty useless for stress/anxiety/panic attacks. Save your money ad get some ZenRx. Night and day difference.[[ASIN:B00HBGBRY4 ZenRx - Dietary supplement reduces symptoms of anxiety, stress, depression, and panic attacks.

15,__label1__,"I bought 2 of these in brown for my island. The hydraulic mechanism looks as though it might fail with over use, but otherwise, I really like them. The color is accurate, as is the description. There is some padding, but not much. Definitely not a chair that you would lounge around in, but great for a bar/counter in the kitchen."
16,__label1__,wonderful headphones had them now for 5 months and works great also great price and the sound is very clear and loud and soft the the ears love my headphones not to mention that they are sony
17,__label1__,"Video quality if superb, fits just fine, looks like a real mirror (I believe they enhanced this), my only gripe is I wish they put the cameras not side by side, but one on one side, the other on the other side. I only say this because due to where the left camera is place, there is wasted recording room when you start to turn it towards the driver side. Otherwise very happy with this so far."
18,__label1__,"As sling shots go, this is good enough for my purposes. Though, I would have preferred for the handle to be slimmer for better grip."
19,__label1__,"just to be fair, i really believe that this is a great slicer , and the idea was there, but unfortunately there are tricks when using this spiral slicer, i mean manual or something would have been helpful.<br /><br />I'm not saying something negative about this slicer because it does work, but however it did it took me almost a week in trying to learn how to use this slicer in cutting different kinds of vegetable.<br />the price i may say is fair, but i do wish that there were manuals in every box in showing us how to use this slicer properly."
20,__label1__,These tablets are especially helpful if you use the Secure dental adhesive.<br />I bought this stuff for my father. and he was satisfied with this.
21,__label1__,Looking decent as same shown in photos Thank You amazon .I saved cost as paint of this type is very costly and as this is digitally print looking decent.
22,__label1__,"I find that the older I get, the harder it is to lose weight....but I've gotten great results taking garcinia this month. I take it before breakfast, lunch and supper. I don't take the one after supper because I don't tend to eat much in the late evenings. I find it really cuts my down my appetite. I've lost 8 lbs this month, which is WAY more than I've lost in a long time."
23,__label1__,"I have had my camera for about 2 weeks now. The pictures are great, it is so easy to use. I love it!!"
24,__label1__,"It is highly recommended not to buy this product.  I took the suggested dosage for a week and felt nothing, no extra energy, no loss of appetite, no pounds lost."
25,__label1__,"The actual power supply is good, but the cable harness's had to be completely taken apart and re-oriented to avoid a birds nest of backwards wiring in tower. It's like they didn't test it to see if it works."
26,__label1__,"My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/wa7AI ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />I was told the enormous benifit of Oregano: it is one of the most powerful healing herbs and natural anti-biotics ever studied. It has been found in a recent study to be significantly better than all of the 18 currently used anti-biotics in the treatment of MRSA staph infections. The strong phenol anti-oxidants destroy pathogenic bacteria, viruses and yeasts. This super herb is very rich in anti-oxidant phytochemical flavonoids and phenolic acids. It is the third highest herb in oxygen radical absorbancy capacity (ORAC) with an impressive score of 200,129. The USDA ranks oregano's antioxidant capacity anywhere from 3 to 20 times higher than any other herb.<br /><br />You can see 2 bottles Oreganol P73 in my fridge. Wowww ... this oregano oil is just the best, it works miraculously! I had discomfort and dryness in my throat, then I took a couple drops of this oil in a tablespoon of water and drank it. This oil healed and soothed my throat almost instantly, and feel great up to now. Another time I felt my body so aching, then I took this oil in the same way - it set me free and felt great just in seconds. This oil is fantastic!!! I also have used oregano as emergency medicine to completely eliminate digestive distress after eating what I found out was contaminated food."
27,__label1__,I love the fact that you can easily read the measurements...great for those of us who's eyes aren't what they use to be LOL. I get so tired of trying to read the numbers on those others where it's the same color as the cup itself.
28,__label1__,I have bought several products from this seller and I have been pleased with all of them. The green coffee does exactly what it says it does! I am happy with it and will purchase another once I am finished with this bottle.
29,__label1__,"This is an extremely well made electric blanket. We tried 2 before this one & took both back. You cannot feel the wires and the material is very luxurious. I did feel it was quite pricey...about $50 more than the ones we took back. However, that being said, the quality indicates it will last for years."
30,__label1__,great product for coffee lover that want little more rich flavor on their coffee. Love that is easy to clean.
31,__label1__,I figured it would for sure fit a dasani bottle.... it doesn't.  I have been able to use it with cheap water bottles though.
32,__label1__,"This dinnerware set provides a very nice aesthetic. It will allow you to set your table very decoratively, and the beauty of a white dinnerware set is that it goes with any color scheme! Before acquiring this particular dinnerware set, I already owned a plain white set of dinnerware; but this set with the platinum rim is much nicer."
33,__label1__,The sides of the case didn't match my phone at all but the real issue is when the tan color became blackish in some parts. Looks unpleasant and can't use like that.
34,__label1__,"Since I have a low pain tolerance this facial hair remover didn't hurt very much. It did take a lot of hair off my face which I love because I hate peach fuzz, especially when wearing foundation. The tweezers were okay, loved the color but it was a little hard for me to use. Wish the package was bubble wrapped because it was so cute but mine got smashed in the process of shipping. Great customer service!!"
35,__label1__,The bag looks like a little smaller version than the one in the picture. The picture shows a lot and describes how much it holds. I found it hard to accommodate my D3100 and two lenses along with the battery charger.
36,__label1__,Bought this to use with my gel eyeliner. The handle is longer than I liked but it works well. I like that it is slanted and very easy to apply and clean.
37,__label1__,"This mask is great for the purpose of keeping out the light for sure! My hubs gets up at 4am to go work and he is a butthead by turning on all the lights. Since getting this, Ive havent had any issues sleeping through it! lol. It looks like a mini bra because its not like your traditional flat sleep masks that lay flat over your eyes. This one has little &#34;cups&#34; that doesnt touch your eyelids at all which is nice because with my old sleep mask it made me itchy. The only reason why I didnt give this 5 stars is because whenever I turned to sleep on my sides it kinda made it uncomfortable to sleep with it on. I had to sleep on my back to make it stay on. For me I hate sleeping on my back so :("
38,__label1__,I used this in my photoshoot last month.. It's really cool.. it has a nice built quality and vintage look.. really awesome..
39,__label1__,"My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/5Zi8I , 600mg a tablet for only 5 cents, additional with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />Recent biochemical and pharmacological studies have identified red yeast rice as a beneficial supplement for maintaining a healthy balance of cholesterol and related lipids in the body. Studies have reported lowering of LDL and triglycerides while increasing HDL. A clinical study on patients who have suffered a heart attack found that a partially purified extract of red yeast rice, reduced the risk of repeat heart attacks by 45 revascularization (bypass surgery/angioplasty), cardiovascular mortality, and total mortality by one-third; and cancer mortality by two-thirds.<br /><br />A recent study has found that nattokinase combined with red yeast rice can significantly lower cholesterol. I use it with Best Nattokinase( goo.gl/32EeB ) and this does a fabulous job of reducing my LDL and overall cholesterol( from 220 to 150 ). Amazing!"
40,__label1__,No go. All the reviews are fake. Buyer be ware. I took it and I got blood in my stool. Stopped taking it right away. Look all the reviews are positive with the same thing to say. Same reviewer. If anyone really took it as i did you would write a 1 star review because no-one wants blood in their stool.
41,__label1__,"My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/5Hndv ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />My personal physician told me that Biotin's role is multi-faceted and the vitamin is used for a number of different purposes.<br />1) Hair, Skin, Nails: Biotin is said to help grow healthy hair, is good for the skin and is used to help treat brittle toe and fingernails. Biotin is also used to treat hair loss (alopecia), and for people with premature gray hair due to low levels of biotin, it has helped combat graying hair.<br />2) Treatment of Candida: Some people use biotin to treat Candida because it is said to be able to prevent yeast from changing into its fungal form.<br />3) Fat Burner: Biotin is often promoted as a ""fat burner"" because one of the principle roles of biotin is to help with the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbs.<br />4) Reduce Blood Sugar: In some cases, doctors recommend biotin to help people with type 2 diabetes reduce their blood sugar.<br />5) Gene Replication: On a deeper level, biotin is integral for gene replication.<br />6) Blood Cells and Bone Marrow: Biotin also helps in the production of healthy blood cells and bone marrow.<br /><br />My hair was thinning from working at a very stressful job. It had gotten to the point where I couldn't successfully make a ponytail. I decided to have a try. After using the Biotin for 3 months, I am happy to report stronger, thicker hair. I haven't seen much growth in the length, but it is very much thicker, prettier, and more manageable. It's so much so that my hairdresser was very surprised! When I went to her to get a trim 2 months after the last haircut, it had grown to the level which would normally have taken 3 months at least to reach :)"
42,__label1__,i have read in many reviews that calcium hampers the burning of fat. But i am taking this since october. I am losing lbs. So i dont really care what it contains as long as it keeps me fit and going.
43,__label1__,Worked as expected and very cheap. It's very lightweight and durable and the length is just perfect for me and my wife. Although we still have 3 spare stylus pens we don't know what to use for.
44,__label1__,"My personal physician recommended this and I bought at goo.gl/xv1lP ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />He told that the extract of pine bark has a beneficial effect in treating over 50 diseases associated with the effects of free radicals, and also provides prevention against them:<br />1) Asthma<br />2) Chronic venous insufficiency (a condition that involves leg swelling, 3) varicose veins, pain, itching, and other skin changes)<br />4) High blood pressure (hypertension)<br />5) Retinopathy (an eye condition commonly caused by diabetes)<br />6) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)<br />7) Blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis)<br />8) Diabetes<br />9) Impotence (also known as erectile dysfunction or ED)<br />10) High cholesterol<br />11) Male infertility<br />12) Heart attacks or strokes<br />13) Leg cramps<br />14) Pregnancy pains (such as back pain, pelvic pain, and leg cramps)<br />15) Painful menstrual periods (dysmenorrhea).<br />16) Pycnogenol is also said to improve athletic performance.<br /><br />""So, tell me what it cant heal?"" I asked. But whatever I had a try. I use it in my type 2 diabetes herbal treatment regimen and to add preventative circulatory and longevity potential to my life one veggie cap at a time. I have been taking this pycogenol for about a month so far and the main thing I have noticed is that my allergies/cough have pretty much gone away completely. At the beginning of January this year I got sick with a pretty bad cold and have had a cough ever since that is only at night and in the morning. My doctor told me that it was most likely allergies or asthma, neither of which I have had before. The pycogenol is the only thing I have added to my regimen of vitamins/supplements in the past month and now my cough is gone.Yay!! I am also hoping this will help with my diabetes which was the reason that I started taking it so hopefully I can report back seeing a benefit on that soon too. I plan to starttaking this twice a day instead of once so I'm hoping that will help."
45,__label1__,It is a true recommendable product which works great on my skin. I take a pill daily with a tall glass of water. It is the best way to restore and refresh the skin from within. My skin looks softer and like it has a glow after using this.
46,__label1__,"Shower curtain is a little thinner than I would like but it works just fine (for the price) with a liner behind it. Also, the darker color is almost too dark --I added some towels and s rugs of different shades of it to bring out the colors...looks nice!"
47,__label1__,I'd like to have a decent speaker set I can use for my dorm room and this is what I got for my budget and it's surprisingly good! The sound is very clear even when set to max volume and bass is decent. Perfect for me and my roommate and for some slumber party. It looks pretty conventional too. I was looking for something rather stylish.
48,__label1__,I don’t really care either way for the scent or appearance. It’s the part where it cleans that I needed.
49,__label1__,Searched all over for a large dutch oven. It's great for browning or carmalizing meat and with its large high grease does not splatter all over my stove. I also love it's ability to transfer it to the oven for roasting or braising. Great for soups. Easy cleanup.
50,__label1__,I had high hopes for a thickening shampoo instead it left me with less hair then before and I feel like it accelerated my hair loss further. I will not continue using it and will return the remainder for a refund
51,__label1__,"I have begun using many of the techniques discussed in this book to help deal with my anxiety and depression. It has been a huge help! I have also begun doing some meditation, and am slowly working on replacing my Zoloft with an OTC supplement. Between these three things, my life has improved 100%.

52,__label1__,This art paper was exactly what I was looking for and made a great present for my younger brother who really loves to draw anything. It was also a great price!
53,__label1__,"The only down side is that i find they are not air tight not good for brown sugar; chips and crackers go stale. My crackers took on the ""taste"" of the container as well. Seem to be fine for my pasta, rice, or cereal that gets eaten quickly."
54,__label1__,"There is no question about the goodness of the camera. The product is as good as a new one (except for the warranty time). I trust this brand and if it's inspected and reconditioned from the factory, I rest my faith in it."
55,__label1__,"Love this case, it's very sleek and slides into your pocket perfectly. Every now and then my phone falls and it has protected it from those mishaps."
56,__label1__,"3 month ago, I found I have recently lost more hair than I used to be every time during shampooing my hair.  I have a thick hair but it seems looked a bit thinner now.Since then, I have been taking any steps that I can possibly to make my hair grow. And i know this product by my friend. After 2 weeks using, my hair has grown rapidly. I've gone from crying over my hair, to being pretty excited about it."
57,__label1__,"This is a nice stylus although I prefer the 'SERENE STYLUS PEN"" due to its small (4mm)nib tip for less screen obstruction. Its also very comfortable featuring its silicone grip. Check it out at  [...]"
58,__label1__,"I bought this camera for its night vision which I have found to be very poor, if you are using this camera in low light it works well however in total darkness it doesn't work at all. I was also using night vision booster LEDs and it still did not work in total darkness."

60,__label1__,It is very helpful to keep the car cool for kids and protect them from heat of the sun while we travel.Easy to attach to the car windows and it really stuck there.
61,__label1__,Useless Christmas gift. Kept on trying to use it on different fabrics with no luck. Produces steam but not enough to do anything. Useless.

63,__label1__,"Pen Drive is very good in this budget, it works faster and no any problem yet, delivery was very fast."
64,__label1__,"The product actually helped out in a lot of areas, particularly where my workout performance is concerned. But I was expecting it to burn fat. Maybe my research was wrong?"
65,__label1__,This is a SMOKING HOT deal. This is the second unit in the last 2-3 weeks They work when you first plug them in but watch out. Somewhere between 1-5 charge cycles these things get so hot you can't touch them. Then they pop and smoke.....game over. No more charging.   The only reason I am giving this a 1 star is the returns have been easy. Reading all of the reviews it looks like about 1 in 3 are good chargers. I'm going to step up and pay the $$$$ for a real one this time.  Don't want to risk burning down the house over a $30 difference between junk and genuine Apple product. Yes it sucks but get yourself the real deal here http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B008ALAAV0
66,__label1__,It really does work. I have been taking these for a month and a half and I have lost about 7 pounds. I am so happy that it works and that I have lost weight. I wanted to give it time before I wrote my review but it is totally worth trying!
67,__label1__,"I am a brown skin young lady who likes the look of a tan. I had a trip plan to Miami. Not wanting to sit outside in the damaging sun for long periods, I thought I would help my tan by using this product. For three days I used this product following the directions exactly as stated. This product did not work. My skin does not have any hint of a tan."
68,__label1__,"This is a fun little gadget to use and I'm a happy camper. It works great and as described. I found the short videos easier to understand than the instructions on the accompanied manual, but you don't need any of those to know how to operate this thing. Very pleased with the tool, however I wish they included a few more recipes."
69,__label1__,"When I made this purchase, I thought it was a expensive. But, it looked exactly like what I had in my mind. I was pleasantly shocked when it turned out to be high grade metal construction. It turned out to be an ornamental piece on my desk. There is no doubt in my mind: This will last a lifetime and look good doing it."
70,__label1__,"$50 for some stinky tablets. Nothing, nada, no effect whatsoever. It's taking me awhile to write a review because I was trying to give them time to work. It wasn't until I landed up in the hospital (Not Because Of This Product) that I realized I blew 50 bucks. The Doc asked me all that I was taking and I gladly told him about this product thinking maybe it was the cause of my hospital stay (It was pneumonia) He and the nurse both sensed my fear and promptly me told me they were just glorified vitamins with big cheesy smiles on their faces. OH THE SHAME!!!!"
71,__label1__,"It of high quality and matched the exact product description. The camera might be a big tough for beginning digital photographers, but it's wonderful for me. I was familiar with most of the features but the instruction manual taught me several new things I could do."
72,__label1__,I really felt like this product did absolutely nothing n I took it for two months. I'm kinda disappointed. :(
73,__label1__,honestly skip the hand pump and get a real motorized one... yes they are expensive but have tremendous value.
74,__label1__,"I am always struggling with my weight. At college I lost the battle. I joined a Fraternity and from there on I gained 32 pounds. It's mostly due to fast food, and beer.<br /><br />I DECIDED to get back on track. I started to run, and do some hitting on a speed bag. With Garcinia Cambogia my appetite dropped and I don't eat as much as I used to.  So far I've lost 6-7 pounds."
75,__label1__,"This company sent me a email after i purchased this on eBay and asked me to review the product on amazon.  They probably should have asked me first what i thought, but here it goes. I bought it for use with my appradio3 and paid an additional $20 to have it installed. After about 2 days, it would not allow video to display constantly and just kept flashing between the warning message and the video about every 6 or 7 seconds. It was like one second of video followed by 6-7 seconds of warning message. It would do it over and over and got really annoying. I took it back to my installer, and they said it was installed correctly. I had no amps, or other stuff and my car does not need a radio module (older car here with no fancy computer stuff except for new pioneer radio). I agreed to an additional $30 removal to have the bypass bench tested and it did the same thing on the bench. The installer fed power to the blue and black wires, and connected an alarm led to the green wire. It did the same flashing on the bench it did in the car. For $20, i dont want to deal with the hassle of returning it, but it cost me more out of pocket and time to make it worth it. I do not know if the seller should be responsible for this, but i did lose out a lot of money due to their product so I am not sure if I should pursue it. I ended up buying another bypass from another company, and it has worked fine for over a month now. Maybe I just got a bad one or what, but it sucked to have to deal with it. Just my $.02 so take it or leave it. My emails to the company through their website still have went unanswered to date, and its been weeks. I searched online about this and diybypass is really a no-name company so go figure."
76,__label1__,"I'm not really sold on the flavor and texture of the contents. When a rather lazy roommate served this, it was a night of hilarity which involved some food throwing. Still, it might just me who is too picky."
77,__label1__,"I am a coffee drinker and considered a pod machine but what the heck, just one cup? I studied the reviews and decided to go with this one. Have no problem with the plastic smell that some have mentioned. Two small negatives that I do have are the display is not lit and can not see in dim light and the sight gage is on the wrong side for the position I have it on the counter, but I can live with these, it makes a great cup of coffee."
78,__label1__,i love the necklace but in order to use them you really need to accessorize and the necklace is really good if you have accessories that can match up to it.<br /><br />it is just fortunate that I have some gothic looking items that can enhance the beauty of this item.
79,__label1__,I recently bought this item and the case did not last more than a week.  I should give it more stars but I cannot.  But for the price.  I guess you can't complain!
80,__label1__,"My 19 month old loves these videos, especially the shapes DVD for some reason. She can say circle and star now, and recognizes some others when she plays with her [[ASIN:B0089W1IGG Baby's First Blocks]]. She can also count from one to five, and names a few letters here and there.<br /><br />I give the videos credit that they hold her attention and she has learned a lot from them. They are slow paced and not too flashy like most cartoons on TV. The animations are colorful and the music is decent.<br /><br />However, they get boring for adults to watch. The videos repeat the word over and over again, which gets tiring for me to listen to. In all fairness the repetition definitely helps her to learn faster so I guess I should just deal with it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* The videos work well.<br />* My daughter loves them.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* Boring for adults to watch."
81,__label1__,Used it in the last few days. It is well made and appears to have high strength and<br />does its job well.
82,__label1__,Toasts bread really nice and looks good on my counter. I haven't had any uneven burns yet and the toaster makes my kitchen look like it has this heavy machinery vibe.
83,__label1__,"I love it. It fits really well in the driver's seat. I'm not used to driving long distances that's why I ordered this one for back support. I tried it first on my computer chair and it really feels comfortable. I like the material of the cover made too. It's soft and very nice material. I tried it on the driver's seat as well and it's perfect. It helps me relaxed my back don't need to actually pull the driver's seat forward. I think I made a great decision in buying this Lumbar cushion. The only thing that I'm worried is the durability of this cushion. I think it's good if you don't use it too much because I feel like it's not hard enough not to sag after couple years. I hope I'm wrong. But you know what, it's perfect for the present and for probably the coming whole year."

86,__label1__,"These are my &#34;go-to&#34; earrings. Very comfortable and the style is great. The only downside (to me) is the wire is so curved they are a little hard to get on, but I guess that means they won't come out (inadvertently) either."
87,__label1__,"Of all the natural oils, I believe this is the best and the one every girl needs.<br />Definitely see a difference in my skin after just 3 weeks of use. And the oil smells very pleasant.<br /><br />Absorbs quick into my face. However, I took a star off because of the dispensing method. I hope they have a dropper or pump."
88,__label1__,"The Holidays are here and so are the extra pounds. Need something to help get the extra weight maintain, Been taking this for the last couple of weeks been eating like crazy and no weight gained which is a good sign, but no weight lost either. Maybe after the holidays I will notice the weight loss because I wont be eating as much."
89,__label1__,"These are odd slippers, they fit great for a day or so and then felt very large. I either shrunk or they stretched out. I have a normal sized foot and they now seem wide and loose. So instead of walking in them I have to shuffle around in them like an old man. For now they will do... I will look around and see what else I can find."
90,__label1__,This organizer arrived today and as soon as I opened the box I was completely DISAPPOINTED at how cheap it looked. I would have rated it NO STARS if I could have.  I have purchased many many acrylic organizers and this is the first time I have ever so sad about one that I purchased.  I will be returning it tomorrow due to it being extremely poor quality.
91,__label1__,"I can feel how I lose belly fat, It is like magic. I never thought this kind of product exist. After started with some cardio 3 day a week the result are even better. Unreliable result, must try it"
92,__label1__,"I have to say that I am pleased with my decision to purchase one of these humidifiers.  The air in my house gets very dry at times and I have woken up to a nose bleed.  That is not a good feeling to waking up to, so I chose to buy one to help with my house and to put moisture in the air.  I can tell a difference in the house already."
93,__label1__,The wife in her ever ongoing weight control regimen has landed on this product with it's 250mg of Forskolin. She likes that it is easy to swallow size and no bad after taste. She has not been late night snacking as much as usual and feel's comfortable that she will lose more than 3 pound's than she has lost in the last week.
94,__label1__,"The keys! They actually feel mechanical, even though they are membrane. They have a sort of tactile feedback without the noise of springs. I would (almost) argue that they have a better feeling then Cherry MX, but are slightly harder to type on."
95,__label1__,My girlfriend and I always use condom because we don't want to mess up.<br />This brand really helps us a lot.<br />I would definitely recommend this!
96,__label1__,It was well worth the money. I would definitely order it again. It is heavy and warm. You would love it. The only thing is trying to stick it back in the bag. Warm that is for sure.
97,__label1__,I thought this was shatter proof my baby (one and a half year old) dropped it to the floor and it broke. Will try customer service and c if they will replace...
98,__label1__,"I enjoy taking a nap when I get home from work. This product not only helps me sleep better, but does so in a way that wont ruin my makeup. The shape of the eyes makes it so that it doesn't even touch your eyelids, so your eye make-up will survive the nap. My only issue with the mask is that light seeps in a bit around the nose."
99,__label1__,"It was so poorly made that it was damaged in getting delivered, twice. I had to keep the second one because my son was going to camp and we needed it right away. Looks nice and rolls nice, but eh box is made of a thin material and rivets were missing and dents. A quality footlocker would have withstood the shipping."
100,__label1__,"I haven't been taking it for very long but I'm excited by the simplicity of the ingredients list!  The capsules are labelled as &#34;Veggie Capsules&#34; which is slightly confusing because no where does it list what exactly is in the pills, just &#34;Forskolin Blend&#34; which...could really be anything.  I plan on doing a little more research on this &#34;Coleus Forskohlii root extract&#34; :)<br /><br />Love as always,<br />~Heather"
101,__label1__,"I started taking Gingko Biloba about 7 months ago because, as I've grown older, I've noticed that my brain processes have slowed down and become a bit muddled.By taking this product TWICE a day for the last 7 months, that 'muddy' sensation in my brain is gone, I can remember the little things that i would normally forget, and I'm able to learn new tricks on my computer again. Thank heavens! I take one pill in the morning and another in the evening.  I am not sure if I will ever stop taking these, they help so much.  I do take the brain teasers online as well and that seems to help with my brain function as well."
102,__label1__,I love how my face feels after using this. I normally use a clay mask but I think I will continue using this one instead.
103,__label1__,I used to Nioxin and really liked it until they changed their formula and lab to mexico.<br /><br />I tried this and its a good cleansing shampoo for what it is but it hasn't help with my scalp or flakes at all.<br /><br />I does smell good and the price is reasonable compared to other brands but I really wished it had worked for me.<br /><br />I will continue to use it and update if it does (and upgrade the stars too)
104,__label1__,"For the price, this is a pretty good receiver, but if you are wanting soemthing that gives you a lot of options and will last a really long time, then I would suugest going with the Onkyo TX-NR616 7.2 version.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0077V88W2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0077V88W2&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwworkoutwei-20"

106,__label1__,"These did not fit my printer even though they were numbered correctly. Speedy Ink included a free pack of photo paper in the mailing, but it was small consolation given I couldn't print. I hope this was a fluke because packaging and shipping = commendable."
107,__label1__,"I have been using it for one week now and I can say it's really amazing. It contains charging station, AC adapter, the charging station has two docks, and you can put the controllers with charging or without charging."
108,__label1__,it was exactly what I was looking for and the price was very good and I would recommend it to everyone thank you
109,__label1__,Much more difficult to use any regular ice tray. The circles don't always come out circular and there's only four cubes in one tray which isn't nearly enough. Even though they give two trays they are still somewhat difficult to use. They banned a lot and are hard to fill with water
110,__label1__,I love these bedsheets. I thought all I ordered was the fitted but actually got the whole set! The price was very reasonable the quality is great. This is the second set I have used and have been happy. Will order another one so I have three sets. I only use this even during the summer months.
111,__label1__,I got this from my best friend. we tried it and at first you would really love the smell. its soooo yummy.  YOu will want to lick it off your face. but dont!. I don't find it to be as effective as it says. I've put it on for about 4 times now.  dont see any change really. But i do love the smell.
112,__label1__,I really enjoy the scent of this Rosemary oil. It isn't super strong but it does the job. I keep it around for late nights and early mornings. Perks me right up so I can get through.
113,__label1__,"Was pretty cheap and works just fine. Holds a good bit of video and pictures, which I needed. I'm a blogger. Formatted fine with my camera and was compatible for my computer. Mac Book Pro."
114,__label1__,"We changed from swaddlers to cruisers when our baby started to crawl excessively. The diapers moved with her better and gave a lot better coverage. Swaddlers were not so leak proof with an active baby. I think she also likes the these better- she seems to smile when she sees them. There've been some changes in the last pack compared to original cruisers though. There liner is the same color as the diaper again and they're thinner. Sometimes the thinner consistency poses a problem, sometimes it does not. It really depends on the day and how much she's gotta go.<br /><br />They seem to hold well overnight- no leaks, but it's not as dry either. As a result, our poor little Lucy has got some diaper rash a few times. She's a screamer when she's got it bad. In those instances we use a heavy strength rash cream by bourdeaux butt paste brand: [[ASIN:B00BMIT1U4 All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste Diaper Rash Ointment + FREE Aveeno Baby Daily Moisture Lotion]]. It absorbs well so it's not left all messy and residue on the diaper when you put a fresh one on. Anything still there at the next change wipes right off her bottom with ease too."
115,__label1__,"Will def light up your bedroom!!It fits me fine and is made out of excellent material!!Nice! A great product, could def see buying another in a diff. color in the near future."
116,__label1__,Fan-Freaking-Tastic  My girl got me this and I laughed and now I'm serious with a beard. I can not vouch for this enough as I have not been able to grow a connecting beard since forever. I'm 32 and I should be able to have a beard and now I do. GREAT GREAT GREAT Product.
117,__label1__,"I have been taking this product along with other vitamins and I have noticed some difference in my energy. I have also lost a couple of pounds, but I have begun exercising as well."
118,__label1__,"I'm enjoying my very first Perlier purchase! It's working well and the 99% Shea will last me a long time. I just scrape a little off, let it melt in my hands, and smooth over dry elbows and heals. It doesn't quite last a full day for me, but close!"
119,__label1__,"There's a lot of mixed reviews...I just want to start by saying each diaper is going to work differently on each baby! They're not all shaped the same, they don't all go to the bathroom the same. It takes patience to find the right diaper for your baby. Just because my friend prefers swaddlers doesn't mean I do too. The Pampers Baby Dry is a good fit for my child. She's pretty small and long. I've noticed my friends with fuller, thicker babies don't have as much good luck. But for me, this is a great, thin, super-absorbant diaper that works well. The price is a great value as well.<br /><br />Be aware though, no diaper will elimnate diaper rash! Despite how absorbant your diaper choice is, your baby will still at some point have diaper rash. My best luck has been butt paste diaper cream ([[ASIN:B00BMIVQ3E All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste + FREE Baby Ganics Thick N' Kleen (Fragrance Free) Baby Wipes]]) because it seals up the sensitive skin and I can still re-diaper my girl right away without a lot of fuss. With diaper rash and rash cream, make sure the diaper doesn't rub anywhere to hard and that they've got some flexibility. The Baby Dry leaves plenty of room for my baby."
120,__label1__,no good looms. at least they're cheap dint wreck my budget. but now i have to buy another pack for my niece. I'll just be getting from the store nearby
121,__label1__,This is a great tackle box for small scale freshwater fishing because of its size. The tackle that comes with this box is very minimal so you will need to purchase a lot of other tackle. Overall this is a great box for the price.
122,__label1__,"Good product, especially for the price. I can hear and be heard clearly on the headset.Love this Bluetooth. Can't really tell that you're wearing it and the clarity is great"
123,__label1__,Got the walker for my father who is 85 and needs help getting around. It helps with the walking and standing more upright.. Great walker at a great price.
124,__label1__,I am adding this to my tattoo aftercare. If it promotes healing from within then I don't see anything wrong with that.
125,__label1__,Best rake I ever had. Seems durable. Its quite light weight which makes me feel that i'm gonna break the rake.
126,__label1__,Children LOVE these bands and have made a lot of really cool different bracelet patterns using them. the tye dye bands make each creation unique because they are not a uniform color.
127,__label1__,"The color of the bag is absolutely amazing! The inside of the bag(lining) had a very strange smell, it was almost fishy. I was very disappointed and was ready to send it back. I turned the bag inside out for a night and the smell has disappeared."
128,__label1__,"I am a middle aged woman, I've tried multiple types of weight loss with no success at all, and I've tried Yoga, swimming and high intensive training sessions, I pretty much had given up and then I found this amazing diet pill, and I can say that the green coffee bean extract with raspberry ketones honestly cut down all these multiple work outs that cost me so much extra in fees, and now I can proudly say I've dropped 15lb.s"
129,__label1__,This thing makes veggies into some real cool shapes. We really enjoy it because there are a lot of hard to peel veggies in our fridge and they are a pain. Not with this tool anymore.
130,__label1__,"This cracked really soon. It seems good enough??? Until it cracked, and I didn't have it but for a day or two. Sad huh?"
131,__label1__,"Great fit for my keys but there too small. But Im glad I got both of them, it is perfect to fit in the pocket."
132,__label1__,"Packaging was adequate. Product installed easily with screws purchased separately, since I have thick drawer fronts. The mounting studs are low on the pull, so if the holes are in the center of the drawer the pull will look high and off-center."
133,__label1__,"Hard to write a review on this mouse, since it is so basic. Used on a Windows 7 system, it was as simple as plugging it in, waiting a minute, and using."
134,__label1__,"I am 5&#34;11 and this is way too short.<br /><br />It is good for my kids.<br /><br />The rope is also sometimes stiff and hard to maneuver<br /><br />Overall, more like a toy but not for high quality work out routine everyday"
135,__label1__,"I bought this for a shower gift, and cannot believe the quality of this product.  The color of the trim and the actual bumper does not match at all.  In addition, the image show raised dot design, and the actual product is flat, I feel cheated.  The zipper bag is broken, I will have to return this since it's not presentable at all as a gift item."
136,__label1__,I've been really pleased with this product since purchasing a few weeks ago. I can feel a difference on my skin and it's helped with my acne and blemishes. I also like the pumice stone for my feet.
137,__label1__,I can't say how this product it yet as we have not even taken it out of the box yet. However it came extremely quickly and in great condition. Can't wait to use it when our sweet baby girl arrives.
138,__label1__,"Why all the bags looking the same??? there are free knight which domain the market, why they keep pooping out same design different brand any where?"
139,__label1__,"Customers are advised to go with the original resource instead since this is not only a rip-off, it is also quite the opposite of what it is supposed to be doing for readers. Seriously, you will only gain weight and be unhealthy when you go with this."

141,__label1__,"I'm a 35 years old mom and I've experienced a really bad hair fall. I have tried Rogaine Foam, Nizoral shampoo and S5 cream, these are top products for hair fall and thinning as well as baldness and they're really effective but has some side effects like dandruff and flaking. However, when I tried VITA RESTORE it maxed out these products. My hair thickened and shines. I've also grown hair for about 2 inches in length which is really great. The dandruff that my previous cream causes now disappeared. And my nails look healthier and growing fast... This is truly one of the best remedies I tried. It's cheaper too!"
142,__label1__,Ordered a 50&#34; belt and was sent a 40&#34;.<br />Wasn't worth it to ship back. Ill use it for a Christmas present.<br />Would not buy again

Its not only great for pasta but, I also used for my potato salad and pasta salad. were going to have party at the park this weekend and will be bring to show everyone. its very sturdy and very well made. it also has a great color so I know its mine easy to spot and not lose it."
144,__label1__,"It will do the job. I do wish that it looked a little more stylish though, but many of the ones that fit that profiles ended up being useless lumps of plastic or steel."
145,__label1__,"I bought these things after reading allot of good reviews. But sadly these didn't meet up to my expectations. The bass is very lacking and the sound is pretty low quality. I am glad I bought them thought to get a personal experience of them, although they are stylish and fold nice that's pretty much all there is good to say about these. So I returned them before the return policy ran out, and moved to another Brand. After trying a few models Skull candy makes, I decided they were not for me."

I never, in my very many one-star, revolutionary reviews conferred on an author a compliment because I am beholding to the great intricacies of the high above expanse the title is impossibly beautiful and one must read it in slow motion to absorb its weight that done, I'm so fast-forward out.

150,__label1__,"I purchased Herbalife a few months ago at my local health retailer and had high hopes for this with the numerous good reviews I read. Although, after using it for 6 weeks fairly regularly, I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Normally people keep eating unhealthy or don't stay active during the use of these kinds of products, but I didn't do that at all. I honestly didn't lose more than 2 pounds at any time during the use of this product. It was hard to comprehend that even after that much regular use, I wasn't losing weight.<br /><br />After realizing this, I decided to try something new. After consulting with friends and family, I went with a product that has been nothing short of AMAZING. I have lost 23 pounds in the last 7 weeks and I have never felt better. This is only the start! I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long to find something that worked for me.<br /><br />If you want to actually lose weight, take a look at this item here on Amazon and give it a chance ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1jSaoQQ<br /><br />Even if you decide it's not the product for you, I'm at least glad I could share my experience about this product and how it did not work for me. I am walking proof that there is SOMETHING out there that works!"
151,__label1__,These are good headphones but you are paying more for the name on the side.  I actually tend to use ear buds more than these.  So quality wise they are good but can find better or same quality for less money.
152,__label1__,"Yes, the effect is slow. However, that should prove that It's actually working. This helps to promote the regrowth of hair; new hair follicles don't grow overnight.  I have been unable to grow back my eyebrows after an accident a few years ago. I purchased this balm, and It's like a miracle for me. My eyebrows are finally starting to grow back, evenly and nicely. If you want a fast acting balm that doesn't have the real effect, don't buy this. If you want something that will take some time but bring long term results, this is the best balm on the market."

156,__label1__,"I am a collector of fitness products, there are three exercise cards on the market (Workout Labs, Strength Stack 52 and Fit Deck) and I will post a brief review of all three here. Just a bit about myself, I am 5 foot 10 somewhat athletic and would consider myself a little above average in terms of my fitness level.<br />Fit Deck<br />Fit Deck has been around for a few years now. I would place them second behind Strength Stack 52 in terms of the quality of workout you can get with these. They have a ton of different decks like bodyweight and basketball and even tai chi, to be fair, I only purchased the bodyweight cards though. Like Workout Labs the exercises were still very basic and lacked the neat gaming component that Strength Stack provides. The owner is a former navy seal (from many years ago), which helps the product, but if you look at him, he has very little muscle tone, which gets me a bit weary.<br />About $16/deck, not very happy with these since they lack any benefit for someone of intermediate or advanced fitness level. If you are a beginner and have no knowledge of working out, you can get these cards, but again, no reason to buy them if Strength Stacks are in stock.<br />Strength Stack 52<br />In my opinion the best of the three workout card companies. From the design to the game play, these cards have some really neat features. Every card has a QR code. The code can be scanned with any Smartphone and a video of the exercise on the card will show me how to do the exercise. Each card is numbered and suited and even color coded by body type. The website has some cool games you can play with the cards, but my buddy and I made up a few of our own. The inventor of the cards, Sergeant Volkin is a military fitness expert and you can tell by looking at him.<br />The best feature of these cards is the exercises themselves. Both Fit Deck and Workout Labs have very basic exercises, Strength Stack has exercises that are dynamic and fun, some of which I have neverseen before.<br />About $16/deck, really great deal, these are the cards I still use months after my purchase.<br />Workout Labs<br />This is the worst of the three exercise cards available. The creator of the cards has no muscle tone, no background in fitness or extraordinary fitness level (to my knowledge) , these cards are purely a marketing play as the owner outright claims he is a designer only. The cards are very, very basic, appealing only to beginners. When I got my cards in the mail, I noticed they were of good quality and waterproof in case you drip sweat on them. But, I have yet to sweat using these cards.<br />PLEASE NOTE: The reviews on this product are fake. I have clicked on almost all of the 5 star reviews and everyone one of them have only reviewed this product. You can even tell they are fake by the way they are written, a bit too perfect. That got me wary of purchasing the cards in the first place, but I still did.<br />The cards are divided into a male and female deck, which is  odd since fitness is unisex. There was nothing to do when I got the cards besides flip a card and look at the illustrations. Given the fact that they were $25 for a single deck of cards, I was hoping for much, much more as there are only 40 basic exercises in the deck. All in all, very disappointed with these.<br /><br />I hope this review helped, I was not paid in any way to review any of these companies."

160,__label1__,"I do a lot of running, and have recently began having some minor joint discomfort in my left knee and hip as a result of training for a marathon. After speaking with my Dr about the pain, he said that I should look at Glucosamine supplements to see if they could help. So over the past few months I have tried a few other products I found in GNC like Instaflex, and GNC's own Triflex and while I noticed a slight difference with each of them I just continued looking to find something that would help noticeably alleviate the pain. I hate taking aspirin and ibuprofen as they both have a tendency to upset my stomach, and like the fact that it is more natural. My running partner recommended this to me, and what I noticed was that it really helped with the pain. I wouldn't say that the relief came immediately, but over about a week I noticed that the pain in my joints was much less, and my joints began to have just a more &#34;smooth&#34; feeling while running. I don't know how else to describe it, but I just don't get that rough feeling I would usually get after a week of running. It is a bit more expensive than I would like which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but I have to admit it has really helped me out."

171,__label1__,I bought this as a gift for my sister in law and she loves it. She does the gel nail polish and loves that she can fit all her fingers in at once. Her old dryer only did one finger at a time. I don't know the long term quality but her initial reaction and her use for a couple of weeks is all positive.

For a long time I began to let those things slip away because I was constantly in pain and aching. Adding a natural supplement to nurture my problems has been a huge relief.<br /><br />Even more effective than the cosaminDS by itself has been combining it with higher levels of glucosamine, chondroitin, and cissus powder: [[ASIN:B009ZP5ERA Glucosamine Chondroitin MSM Blend w/ White Willow Bark 750 mg (60 Capsules) + FREE Cissus Joint Powder 100 Grams]]. The blend of those supplements has alleviated all my major aches and complaints as well as made me less stiff after sleep or sitting for prolonged periods of time. I can make it up my front steps without growling in pain."
174,__label1__,"I was surprised at how well packaged these tables were. The quality was great for the price; the color was exactly as advertised. They came all put together, they are nice and well worth the money. They are exactly what I wanted."
175,__label1__,"The mold is really nice. I tried one of my grandmother recipes and it come out fabulous. I was a bit worried that it would stick, because the recipe doesn't have oil in it, but I have to say that the silicone pan is great and the loaf didn't stick at all. the size is a bit smaller than a normal loaf pan but its so much more stylish."
176,__label1__,"I received this in record time, and it smells great! It isn't overpowering, like some brands, and the oily feeling isn't slippery or greasy--which is the sign of a really good quality essential oil. I like that it comes with a glass dropper that actually goes to the bottom of the bottle. At the moment I type this, it's making my headache go away."
177,__label1__,I purchased this product about a month ago and have loved the results. I highly recommend this for anyone interested in suppressing their appetite and losing weight.
178,__label1__,Great for a one time use. This is not something that you would use over and over again. However for 5 dollars you can use it once. It is very high quality and you do not have to worry about buying something expensive that you will never use agian.
179,__label1__,"Junk! Only people who like it are probably paid for it. We had 2 weeks of complete frustration. It did not go off when it should, and went off when it shouldn't. The funny noises that &#34;rotate&#34; were a nuisance. We gave up and got something for less than half this things price, and that worked well."
180,__label1__,"This is Elizabeth's second gluten free book.. The first one emphasizes the general info on gluten free living...this second one has more recipes...anyone looking to improve their gluten free choices, this is a good choice."
181,__label1__,"It is a Multi Function color laser printer, scanner and dual sided printing/scanning. If you do not need this last option there are printers about HALF the size and weight. I'd go for it but my parents sometimes need the dual sided function.<br /><br />Well, it's a good printer for Office use. Do not even think on printing resolution pics on it, it does not output well, specially with other kinds of papers.<br /><br />Be also aware of the &#34;dial&#34; that keeps warning you to change toners when you don't need. Just look on youtube for videos on how to reset the toner counter on the side dial."
182,__label1__,"This is a great jar, it holds up well and it has no leakage at all. However, ensure to tighten the spout if you plan on filling it up all the way to the top. I got the jar to brew kombucha and so far its serving the purpose just fine."
183,__label1__,It absorbs quickly and completely and leaves skin oh so smooooth but the smell of the lotion doesn't suite me.  I would love it if this also came in a variety pack with nice smell. I also ordered the Bay laurel foot and leg lotion and found it to be just as great. I will be ordering more of this as the weather cools.
184,__label1__,It is hard to control the phone through the plastic.<br /><br />I have to get it out to access the app then put it back in..the armband itself however is comfortable and the functions are excellent.
185,__label1__,"It has a good quality considering a cheap price, compared with high end goggles and more expensive ones I found it very good in terms of design and features. I recommend this brand to newbies as well as to professionals. It's a great goggles."
186,__label1__,"I have been using these for about 2 months and they worked pretty well, but not quite what I was expecting. I definitely saw some improvement though. I switched over to Phytoderm, [[ASIN:B00IT4POOG PhytoDermTM- The Best 100% Pure Skin Restoring Anti-Aging Phytoceramides, 350mg! Clinically Proven! Facelift in a Bottle - As seen on Dr. Oz! Help Your Skin Look Younger And More Vibrant - Sells Out Fast!]] and within a few weeks I started to see what I was expecting from a phytoceramide. I am not sure what the difference is, but its worth the extra couple bucks for the 20-30% improvement. Both good products, but the phytoderm is certainly the better of the two."
187,__label1__,"I was told that fabulous benefits are gained from using Phytoceramides products such as Phytoceramides capsules, Phytoceramides for skin and Phytoceramides supplements. This product has helped me in keeping the skin smooth, getting rid of lines and wrinkles, healing damaged skin and improving the firmness of the skin and elasticity. Itchiness and redness has also been reduced after using this product. However, the results were a bit slower than what I expected."
188,__label1__,The headset has worked great in my household. I have left them on my head and realized they were working clear as a bell downstairs when I retrieved something to drink. What clarity they have! Tune them in and you're all set. I've even laid down with them and they don't turn off like others have. All the controls are on the side of the ear piece and don't get in the way of lying on side. What a great deal!
189,__label1__,It wasn't so clear as advertised when I got it and it has gotten worse over time as became brownish color. Scratches everywhere and not pleasant looking after a short time.
190,__label1__,We bought this Armoire for our 9 year old granddaughter for her birthday. This is something she should be able to use long into her adulthood. It is very well made and is very roomy. Happy with my purchase since my grand daughter is happy.

192,__label1__,"This thing makes dealing with a pineapple easy. But i suggest you buy the tall pineapples rather than the short fat ones. The unit is not adjustable, so you leave a lot behind when you do a stubby pineapple."
193,__label1__,"These are the lowest calorie bar with the highest fiber and protein ever. Plus they are so good that when Harps stopped caring them they sold out. Very tasty, not too sweet. Great for healthy snacking."
194,__label1__,"These were a bit thin for Wisconsin winters. The sheets are very soft though. If used with thick blanket, they will do."
195,__label1__,The one I received was not sharp. Used it on straight hair and it did not cut well. It tugged and pulled at the hair even though the hair was short. I guess I just got a bad one. I sent back.
196,__label1__,"Very nice sheets.Thick and comfortable. I personally hate sheets with synthetics, so these feel good. Only regret is I got burgundy, should have gotten peach."
197,__label1__,"Ok, no one tell my son this....but, I actually put this baby food (always use organic!) in his muffins.

Cleaver mommy...heehee"
198,__label1__,I was looking for trash bags that I could buy online to help save time (and possibly money) because the kind I normally get is only available in the . For the similar quantity these bags were cheaper and I was able to buy online.
199,__label1__,"The reason so many reviewers have been disappointed with this product is not because of the quality.  Any tribulus product that contains 45% Saponins, is simply not going to compare to a tribulus that contains a high concentration of Protodioscin (the main ingredient responsible for the benefits I gets when taking tribulus).  The most potent form of tribulus is extracted at a ratio of 90%, [[ASIN:B007RLZDBQ Tribulus Terrestris 90% Bulk Powder 50 Grams]].  Even than I would still recommend combining it with some longjack or DAA, if increasing testosterone levels is your main motivation for taking it in the first place."
200,__label1__,It didn't fit my phone tightly as I hoped which makes me uncomfortable as the sides seem to wiggle with the slide of a finger. There are better options at same price range.
201,__label1__,"This is all I needed. I am tired of paying more money for simple products that do nothing special, that is why I bought from Stalion. Simple brand that costs decent and that does everything the product ought to. This battery has a good performance and good price, which makes it a good purchase I guess. I can say I am not regretting this purchase so far."
202,__label1__,Now this is what I am talking about. I am happy and satisfied with this purchased.  I will be buying more of this.
203,__label1__,"What do the negative reviewers honestly expect from this product? From the moment I opened it, I knew that it was exactly what I had in mind. The content could be more substantial though. That's my only quip."
204,__label1__,"Exactly what I wanted. It's spacious inside and really don't take up much space on the door, fit neatly in place. Note to the manufacturer, please do a better finishing job at the corners. Made in America should be excellent...I will recommend this product."
205,__label1__,"We have the light charged, resting on counter in laundry room, ready for the next power failure. We like the handy feature of the light for certain jobs."
206,__label1__,I used this right away. Dark circles run in the family. I think I look better! :) The product makes my eyes soft.
207,__label1__,"These chairs are very inexpensive but they look good, they are comfortable. Assembly wasn't too awful. For the price, i'd say these were a good deal.."
208,__label1__,"After using lipogaine minox for a few months decided to give the shampoo a shot. Absolutely hate IT! MADE MY HAIR shed tremendously, and it smells awful.  I would advise to stay away!!! ALL REVIEWS on this shampoo seem FAKE."
209,__label1__,"I have been pounding it out pretty hard,thanks to this stuff.I would say,go buy this stuff and get your sex on !!!"
210,__label1__,"I have to say, with all of the junky MacBook battery replacements out there, I had my hopes quite low when I decided to buy this instead of buying an OEM replacement one. After a good deal of research and review reading I finally made my mind and bought this Key Power's battery and to be honest, so far it has been great. It gave me about 3 hours of unplugged power after 1st charge and cycle, and has actually improved in the 2 weeks since I got it. I'm not sure how long it will last, but the 18 month warranty makes me feel comfortable. I'm glad that I took."
211,__label1__,"Every time I got a headache, I drink two of this Advil liqui gels. 1 liqui gel is not enough for me.. It's very effective though.. Gonna buy 1 box.. I get a lot of headaches these days.."
212,__label1__,"I used to use a oscillating fan to help me sleep.  But when it's cold you don't want a fan circulating air in your room all night.  For some reason the noise this machine puts out is much more soothing than an electric fan.  Just turned off a little by the price but hey, tons of people have nothing but good things to say and I am backing them up!"
213,__label1__,This item is splendid! It fit the way I needed it to and holds my Galaxy S5 and there are no worries about it dropping out. Used it for running and it held up great!<br /><br />I have bought ones that were definitely more expensive that didn't work half as well or did not go on right. Terrific item!
214,__label1__,"Cheap but Not working, come with only few accessories, Power supply not working well. the inks is useless, Don't try to use the ink and the needles for real skin tattoo or got infection.."
215,__label1__,"Pros:<br />-maintains the standard Zippo design and distinctive ""click"" sound when opened.<br />-very compact design, fits really nicely in my hand and pocket for easy carry.<br />-black matte finish is quite gorgeous. I wanted something different from the typical chrome finish and am not disappointed! The black finish also holds up well to use and handling.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-since the lighter is so small, you may find that the usage varies quite a lot from when it is full to empty on fuel. The flame can vary in height and intensity. Also, I notice the smell of unburned lighter fluid quite frequently. Refueling often becomes necessary."
216,__label1__,"Worked great although I needed to update some drivers on my PC running XP to see the card. But after four months it just died, cannot re-format. Never had it in any extreme conditions, lost all my data."
217,__label1__,"Defective, leaking.The inside hose is too small restricting water flow to about half of what I used to get from old hose. It took me a lot more time rinsing off the soap. Unless you have all the time and don't mind spending half an hour showering then don't get this hose. Save yourself the frustration."
218,__label1__,"Original Carrera is much better I think. it is a great composition - one that stands out. Impressive juice...this will not be duplicated, ever.

219,__label1__,"Assembly was pretty easy, although the provided allen wrench couldn't turn all the way around, making it a bit tedious. The glass is pretty thin, which makes me wonder about it breaking in the future, and would probably look better frosted. Overall, decent value for the money."
220,__label1__,a very useful glass i use every day in the kitchen. they are perfect for when you have some friends over and want to bring some cocktails or soda...
221,__label1__,"It's noisier than I would have preferred but it's not to a degree that I can't tolerate. Besides, the results are great and my kids always enjoy their snow cones."
222,__label1__,"XS pills work on so many levels, and I think that's due to the green coffee and tea extracts that are in them. My body has reacted really well, meaning I just feel energetic and chipper all of the time. And of course I've lost weight, too, almost 30 pounds in just under 2 months. All in all, I love everything about these. Would definitely buy again."
223,__label1__,"This works very well. I have pale fair skin and have puffy eyes with dark purple bags. I have to continue using products like this because I constantly get the bags. I discontinued use of the one I was on and did not use anything for a week. My bags were back. I started using this and you can see that it worked very fast, the puffiness was gone and the bags faded fast. They are even toned & soft"
224,__label1__,"My scalp was allergic to most color brands, over the counter and at the best salons. This is the best colorant for me haven't had that problem since. My hair is so shiny, soft and it is a beautiful color."
225,__label1__,I was shocked at the awful smell and the fact that I could not feel anything good about this product.  I used the whole bottle and it just seems to be a placebo that really does not work.<br /><br />I am switching back to my old resveratrol
226,__label1__,I ordered two pairs. They got delivered much faster than the 4-6 weeks I was expecting. I think it was only 7-10 days. They are OK headphones
227,__label1__,"When I use a product, I don't want to settle with what is just good. It has to be mind-blowingly excellent. So far, this product has only been good."
228,__label1__,"Picked this up for my daughter, she does like the color.  Haven't taken her out fishing yet with it so we'll see how it does in actual use.  But so far seems pretty decent."
229,__label1__,"Super sharp, this cut my finger once becasue I was holding it wrong. Great item, not cheap at all, has a nice weight to it unlike the other plastic ones."
230,__label1__,"It is really great! I gave it to my wife and she is really happy. Thanks to this tool, I can never be bothered seeing my wife using her bare hands applying her Eyelashes extension."
231,__label1__,"I am still learning the art of getting these molds filled correctly, but am starting to have a bit more success. I used the ice for the first time this week and I was a little bit non-plussed by the length of time they lasted. I was using the ice inside, in a controlled-temperature environment and I can't say that I noticed they lasted any longer than say, a cube from an actual ice cube tray. However ... I still think they are worth it because the look much cooler than a cube! I am eager to try using filtered water to see if I can get crystal clear ice balls. The ball is about the size of a golf ball. I would like it to be a bit bigger (I am starting to giggle as I write this) so you could plop one in a rocks glass instead of two. However, this size also fits in tall, slim glasses. They're fun! If you're serving drinks or just enjoy a good sip of Scotch, you should have these."
232,__label1__,These smell bad and the nifty nose piece that attempts to keep the light out doesn't do so at all.  all I can say I like about it is the little ear bud holders in the strap I think that's cool.
233,__label1__,This is the easiest way I've found so far to completely cut snacks out of your diet. Within two weeks I was able to stop everything. I'm still taking the pills though because I haven't lost any weight. We'll see how it goes.
234,__label1__,I have this case a friend actually bought it for my galaxy s4. It protects the phone very well but the sound quality isn't that great when your talking to someone. you feel like you need to put it lauder or take the case off but at the same time if you want your phone to be safe you should get this cases.
235,__label1__,What else is there to say... We have a newly installed vinyl floor in our kitchen and didn't want any indents or markings from our chairs. These are easy to install and keep my chairs sliding easily across my floor and leave no dents or marks on the surface.
236,__label1__,A nice rapid charging case that is compact and does not add too much bulk. You will get about 2 full charges out of this case which will easily get you through 1.5 days of moderate to heavy usage. It works with iphone 6 4.7&#34; model only not to be used with iphone 6 plus 5.5&#34; model. Easy way to tell battery life by pressing metallic button on the bank once and pressing again to turn off to stop from wasting battery of the case.
237,__label1__,Scratches like crazy and the sides discolored quickly. My main issue is that I have dropped my phone from 3-4 feet and the bottom side of my phone is dented. I can't believe it got dented through the case.
238,__label1__,"very good quality, as with all products from luminarc. I find the plain design interesting and more useful than having a highly decorated one. A good deal too as i bought them when teh were on sale."
239,__label1__,"These pillows tend to be comfortable, We have these currently intended for couple of weeks and so i don't believe it has been even a 30 days since i own these, they tend to be fine if you ask me. The stiffness is actually good however I can point out to people that it is a brand new wedge pillow and so i do not recognize how lengthy would in which stiffness would last."
240,__label1__,"The watch is good, and half a month to evaluate it.. Function is very full, then call, send and receive text messages, as long as the phone can receive messages including QQ micro channel, etc. can be pushed to the watch, but can not back. Note2, Android 4.3 perfect compatible! Beyond the expected watches and mobile phones can actually connected via the Internet, this just can't pick up the phone can send and receive text messages, push missed calls and all mobile phone to receive the news."
241,__label1__,Love taking this product right before my workouts. I have noticed improvement in my strength and would recommend to anyone looking to lose weight.
242,__label1__,I haven't activated it yet bit I did try to enter some info in it and i found it to be very fast and sooo sensitive. the only thing i question is how difficult it is for me to enter numbers...maybe i just have fat fingers.
243,__label1__,"The counter stool is great for the price, and the fact that it is available immediately is a big plus. Most stores we went to required a few weeks to prepare. The wood has a nice smooth polish to it, the stands are very stable, and they look great in our kitchen. However there is one drawback that I have noticed. After only 2 months of use, the cushion has started to basically wear out thin. Not noticeable from the outside, but when you sit on it, you can feel the nails and wooden frame underneath. Not really comfortable after say 10-15 minutes."
244,__label1__,"its a great read, facts to be read is just so shocking and the same time amazing, Love it, I just love it...."
245,__label1__,"It's perfect size for purse or travel. It comes in a little spray pump bottle with a lid. It has no smell, oily, it dries quickly and it's sticky. I hate having to  wait for hand sanitizer to dry. Great for people on the go. Excellent shipping time."
246,__label1__,I have friends and family who purchased nearly exactly the same spa and paid twice as much for it. I really did my homework and shopped around and you guys definitely had the best prices. I love this spa! It has all the features I was looking for and the quality is fantastic. Setup was easy breezy beautiful!
247,__label1__,"Great face mask of minerals from dead sea. Shipped with prime. It gives a burning/tingling sensation for a lil while when u apply, but the skin feels soft and fresh after. All natural cleanser and exfoliator. Came with an ebook which you can download online, havent looked at that much though."
248,__label1__,"Libro que parece haberse escrito bastante aprisa sin detenerse mucho a profundizar en los personajes. El escritor vuelve sobre el socorrido tema de Cuba, aunque no presenta nada novedoso. Los lectores no hallaran aqui algo que ya no se haya dicho antes en otras novelas."

250,__label1__,"I took this and didn't feel very well afterward. It wasn't horrible, I just felt a little bit nauseous. I started reading some of the other reviews and began to be concerned. Should I be?"
251,__label1__,"This chair is quite durable. I bought it for my daughter's room and she is happy with it. The seat and back are very fluffy and comfortable. The only thing I'm not happy about, is the color. I bought the blue since my daughter's bedroom walls are painted a very light blue, like the color shown online for this chair. If the chair color actually looked like the one in the online photo, it would be perfect. But it is a much darker blue than it is shown and I was very disappointed with that..."
252,__label1__,"I recently began a new fitness program that put a pounding on my 55 year old joints. I was so sore that it was discouraging me from working out. I wanted to continue making great progress toward my goal but without the joint pain. I did some research and read several reviews about Glucosamine Chondroitin and MSM. I decided to try Kirkland brand and it worked pretty well. Pain subsided a bit but my joints were still achy, but a definite improvement. These tablets are also really big and difficult to swallow. I found another supplement called Flexadrene that contains Glucosamine, Chondriotin and MSM along with over 20 other ingredients that relieve joint pain [[ASIN:B00NOG20ZK Flexadrene – Complete Joint Care Formula]]I have been taking these for a month and my joint pain is all but gone and my workout regimen is even more intense. Plus, the Flexadrene pills are much easier to swallow. Overall, this is a good product, but if you don't mind spending a few extra dollars, I suggest trying Flexadrene."
253,__label1__,This is great for things like axes or other utility blades but you should forget about using this for your kitchen knives.
254,__label1__,I can't iron fast on a blanket.<br />Lucky that my mom gave me the old ironing board that she had before.<br />It was not new but looks like it's not.<br />Thanks to my gorgeous mom who gave this!
255,__label1__,"Great fun. I bought these for my kids, and they had a great time making designs on their own nails, and playing salon. The free refill offer is excellent. Nice product."
256,__label1__,Great stuff.  This mud mask is not only fun to use but feels great.  It definitely made my pores look smaller and made my skin feel firmer.  It was easy to put on (for a mud mask) and felt fine while it was on.  I would recommend using it maybe once a week or so.  My grandkids thought it was hilarious too!!
257,__label1__,"To put in few simple words. If you like Buffett or if you want to learn more about him , then buy this book now :)"
258,__label1__,"Ahhh!! Im so happy to have found just blue jolly ranchers.  Like someone else stated, there never seems to be enough blue in a bag of mixed flavors.  And all my friends fight over the blue ones. lol  I just wish the price wasn't as high as it is.  But ill pay it to have my blues"
259,__label1__,its not a bright blue as you would expect. Its a dark green rather..But still a nice color.Does get smudgy after a while..
260,__label1__,This is so hard to do. But it works.<br /><br />If you want to look great you have to work at it. This program directs you how. And for that I will pay the price because it is a lot more cheap than hiring a trainer.
261,__label1__,I like it to shower with. The fragrance does quickly disappear. The bottle is only nice for appearance. I really like the honey moisturizing. that's it that's all.
262,__label1__,This clock is exactly what I was looking for and fits my space perfectly. Thus far it has kept great time and looks good over the mantle
263,__label1__,"I don't really know what I was expecting when we got this. I thought that at least my toy pooch wouldn't bark or growl as much for no reason. Throughout the time that we spent on trying this however, her barking didn't let up one bit. She still barks even when the neighbor's car slams at night."
264,__label1__,"Okay, on my part I would give it 4 stars reasoning being that its lid is not fine with those soft vegetables. However, with carrots, it's just as it has been illustrated in the photos which is what made me purchase it. That is a minor issue and wouldn't be fair not recommending it to anyone and they can be ready to make some salad which is delicious and quite appealing to the eyes"
265,__label1__,"These are real than the screen, like my friend. Exquisite craft and realize the value of the funds is truly wonderful."
266,__label1__,"This is a unique concept compared to a lot of other teething products. There are plenty of really awesome necklaces that are baby safe for chewing and I utilize them a lot- [[ASIN:B00E7OXN22 Pendant Baby Teething Necklace - Non-Toxic Jewelry for Mom, Safe for Babies to Tug, Touch, and Chew! - Buy 1 Get 1 FREE!]]. It's a super convenient way to keep the teething toys with you at all times without worrying about them falling on the floor or getting thrown if you're out shopping etc.<br /><br />What makes this particular piece unique is that from a distance, you'd think it was actually jewelry. It's safe but it's multifaceted obviously so that makes it great for moms like me. Unless you're right on top of me you really can't tell it's beat up at all. It's great to know there's something I don't have to be embarrassed about if I forget to set it aside (we've all been there- puke on shirts...you know ladies) before we go out later or something along those lines."
267,__label1__,Just built my friend a new office computer with this chip and very happy with the build. Chip runs cool and does everything that she needs including graphics editing and excel spreadsheets.
268,__label1__,My dog won't take these. Dogs usually know when there is not good product. Is it really dasuquin in these tablets?
269,__label1__,"I like the unit and once running it does everything expected. However, it does not like to be hurried when first starting. You need to turn it on and leave it alone or it gets locked up. Gets very annoying when trying to watch a new movie. Once started however it works great."
270,__label1__,This pressure oven does a superb job on roasting turkey and chicken. They come out moist and tasty in a short period of time.The feature doesn't work to well though. The rod becomes disconnected when the oven heats up under pressure and of cores it quits turning and even fell out once. If you cook without pressure it stays in place but takes longer and you loose the moistness.
271,__label1__,"Went for the price but no major regrets. The light has to be placed at the right place without too much obstruction/ objects around. Can cover only a small area, around half a tennis court. The cord is also a bit short. All complaints were made by my son, who used it for his indoor party. I on the other hand am very content with it for the purpose that I bought it for."
272,__label1__,I really love this Gold Plated flatware. It is sooo beautiful. I do wish you would see if you can manufacture some matching ice tea spoons. Then the set would be perfect.
273,__label1__,"The design on this is a lot more prominent than I expected. And although it's very thick and sturdy, it's also light as a feather, which is great. I like how it doesn't look like your typical yoga mat bag."
274,__label1__,The quality of this bathrobe does not nearly come close to what was advertised especially considering the high price. I can get one just as thick in any one of the inexpensive chain stores. I just touched the fabric and was very disappointed. Returned it without opening it at all.
275,__label1__,To be honest I was a little dissappointed with this game. I bought it becuase the store had a good deal on it and I decided to give it a shot.  I think this game has some glitches that should have been worked out before release. But I haven't had some of the problems other reviewers here are saying is in the game. If these glitches were worked out I'd give it five stars. I just don't think it's as bad as some people are saying.
276,__label1__,"Had to send the first one back. The release mechanism was defective. No hassle returns policy, ordered the second one, but had to settle for another color...OK, the new one worked fine. Great size."
277,__label1__,This product was weak and barley gave me the extra kick I was looking for to increase workout performance. This product may work well for people that are sensitive to stimulants or new to supplements.
278,__label1__,What I particularly find useful is the topic on app security. The author really did a great job in explaining the engine behind external app authentication using OAuth and S2s high-trusts.
279,__label1__,"When the light turned on, it looks good! Unfortunately, the music does not work!<br />One end of a two-lane, if you do not want the music to a separate, possibly during transport. If you happen I can not give five stars!"
280,__label1__,I was surprised at how big this toy is. The assembly took a little over an hour and the girls were helping as much as they could. They were very excited and have spent a lot of time playing with it with their barbies.
281,__label1__,It's a nice case for the price. It is easy to slip on. It protects the phone by creating about a 2mm gap between the case and the phone. It also has about a 2mm lip over the front to protect the screen if you drop it. But I'm a little disappointed with the color cause it's slightly brighter pink than the picture shows. I was hoping for a peachy pink and it is a little brighter than that.
282,__label1__,"The premise of And Only to Deceive excited me enough to get a copy the very same day I first heard about it. The idea of a reverse love story, a woman falling in love with the man she married only after his death, married with the mystery/suspense, as well as the Victorian setting appealed to me very much.<br /><br />Alexander portrayed the romantic part of the romantic suspense in an elegant and intelligent manner. Through reading his journals, Emily is astounded to discover that the ordinary aristocrat she thought she had married harbored passionate love for her and was far more interesting than she knew. This made me question Emily's intelligence and powers of observation, though. Was she so self-absorbed that she didn't take the time to get to know the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with? The more she finds out about Phillip, the more regret grows until Emily falls in love with her dead husband and begins to truly mourn him. Rather than letting her heroine lionize Philip, without question, Alexander then begins to poke holes in his character and Emily's idolatry of him. In keeping with Emily's newfound interest in Greek antiquities and Greek literature, there is a long-running discourse throughout the book regarding who is the better hero, Achilles or Hector. Alexander uses this discourse in subtle comparison to Emily's love for her dead husband - the man she never knew and built up in her mind as an incomparable demi-god (like Achilles) with her flawed (but alive) suitors (like Hector, a human who dares battle Achilles, protected by the gods, to protect his kingdom).<br /><br />I liked Alexander's exploration of Emily's liminal role in Victorian society as a widow, neither mother or wife or virgin bride-to-be. She comes to the realization that without a husband, yet with his fortune, she is basically a free woman, able to do as she pleases within or even out of society.<br /><br />Emily's character, however, made no emotional connection with me. Other than being very beautiful, so much so that her dead husband's secret nickname for her was Kallista (the most beautiful) and being an avid reader, she was not very interesting. I could not see why sophisticated Philip fell in love with her; however, Alexander shows that perhaps, like Emily falling in love with the dead Philip, Philip also fell in love with a figment of his own romantic imagination. He didn't know her, but chose her for her beauty, as Paris chose Helen for hers.<br /><br />Emily develops, however, throughout the course of the story. Initially inspired by her husband's interests, she develops interests of her own: Greek antiquities, learning ancient Greek, the epic poems. She also explores her newfound freedom as an independent woman of means.<br /><br />""Dissatisfied, I put down the book, irritated that Philip was not there. I desperately wanted the chance to argue about these things with him. As I sat there, I slowly began to realize that my own opinions were quite different from those of my husband. Until then I had attributed all my interest in classical antiquity to Phillip and had assumed that his own studies would serve as an adequate guide for mine. I no longer felt driven to study as a way to know Phillip. I wanted to study because I loved the poetry, because the beauty of Greek sculpture moved me...""<br /><br />The suspense part of the novel was lackluster and slow-moving. While I liked the discussion of Greek antiquities and details of the Impressionist art movement, I was never gripped with the fervent need to get to the bottom of whodonit. The sequels sound like they're set in some amazing locales; however, I don't believe I will be continuing this series."
283,__label1__,"I think this product works as described but it lasts not very long at all, maybe a couple hours of increased focus and alertness but that is it.  For the price I would expect this to last all day or at least most of the day. At this rate I would need to reorder a new bottle every 2 1/2 weeks.  I'm sorry but I can't afford to do that."
284,__label1__,"This is a toy not a medical product. It stopped working in just 1 day, the silly trumpets don't sound anymore. I'll just count it as money in trash. It's an absolutely useless product. No wonder it's priced at 30 bucks."
285,__label1__,Good enough for the outdoors if it was right in front of you.  You hear the mosquitoes get zapped.  its disgusting cleaning it though.  I guess you could always get  a new one.
286,__label1__,"The lack of physical activity caused me to have cellulites on both my thighs and legs, I've done lots of exercise to get rid of them but none of them worked. I had told by a friend of mine that cellulite cream with retinol and caffeine will work and so I ordered this product, two weeks after using it on a regular basis and I have seen a significant improvement. This product is what I'm looking for!"
287,__label1__,"good price, quality is okay, but for the price is good enough,will buy few more as gift for my friends"
288,__label1__,This is exactly what I was looking for. Prevented my phone from breaking after couple of drops also.
289,__label1__,I don't know why but after seeing the images and reading this I felt like I wanted to hurl really bad. It was especially annoying since I just ate some excellent sushi and I was not about to waste a good salmon roll.
290,__label1__,"This is definitely worth the minimal time and effort. Just one pill a half hour before your meals and boom. You're losing weight and feeling better inside and out every day. At least thats the hope. For me it worked, I actually have a friend who bought them at the same time as me who hasnt had the results Ive had.. Not sure the deal but I can't be happier with what's happening with me."
291,__label1__,"We needed a second one (I have twin boys and they could share one when they were really young, but not anymore) and this one is a great buy for the money. All the features of Pack n Play - easy set-up, etc. for under my budget. You can hardly find one second-hand for that amount."
292,__label1__,"This bracelet is gorgeous, but I found it so uncomfortable. I don't have large wrists, but my wrist bones do kind of stick out. No matter were I placed the cuff, it was hitting my wrist bones. I had to return it."
293,__label1__,I absolutely love this movie!  In my opinion it is the best western movie out there.  Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell are great actors. This movie is going to get watched over and over and over.  haha
294,__label1__,"I feel some stinging in my teeth every time I use this product. And I know it really works though, because I’ve seen my teeth get a lot whiter. Overall I’m happy with this, and have no major complaints."
295,__label1__,"I use this product to steam clean our curtains, my daughter's stuffed animals/throw pillows when I can't or don't have time to wash them. Easy to use. It's easy enough to use but it tends to get a little heavy when doing larger jobs but that would be the case with any appliance."
296,__label1__,"Once again, dealing with them was a pleasure. It is a handsome and functional wallet, well made from high-quality materials. I expect it to give years of good service."
297,__label1__,"Perhaps it's because I'm surrounded with a dense miasma of collective pop culture references all day, but I found The Goldfinch quite captivating. It's good to suspend the more intense inclinations of the mind and simply allow it to be submerged in the story. On the other hand, I can understand the disappointment that some might feel if they think that the quality did not meet their expectations."
298,__label1__,Really like these candles. Gave 2 for gifts and kept one for myself. Elegant looking and works great. Enjoying the timer option and fact that I can put in a location you would never be able to put a real candle. Put inside TV stand and adds to decor.
299,__label1__,"The instruction page very easy to follow and understand. The fact this is waterproof is a major plus, as we do get rain and showers during the months my vegetable garden is planted and grown. I am just really happy that the squirrels and skunks don't beat me to my garden grown vegetables, and I would highly recommend this item."
300,__label1__,I never thought I would ever pay as much as $20 for a travel mug. But I really got tired of making coffee in the morning and having it be lukewarm by the time I got to work. This mug is the perfect solution. Overall a well-made product that I hope to enjoy for a long time.
301,__label1__,"The display is large enough to read from across the room, even in daylight. So far it is very accurate and is happy it has a built in battery for backup, as we sometimes get momentary power hits."
302,__label1__,"I decided to spend a few extra bucks for the peace of mind of knowing this thing was going to work without hassle. Once again, ASUS didn't let me down. Put in my i7-3770k and everything started up with no problems."
303,__label1__,I have wanted this watch for a long time now and finally made my purchase. I didn't like that you can't really see the LED outside in sunlight. It's OK when's the sun goes down or if you're in a nightclub. I won't return it because of the cheap price and it makes a good conversational piece.
304,__label1__,Nice watch for my friend's kid. I received it on time and in an excellent condition. Kids like it. I would recommend this as a good item to gift someone especially kids.
305,__label1__,"i like how minimalist this stand is, it doesnt take up much space and it looks very classy as well. One thing i hate about it though is that its difficult to adjust the inclination, its because the stand its self doesnt hold especially when you have a glass table."
306,__label1__,This is actually comfortable and not at all like my last helmet which was incredibly distracting whenever my husband and I would go out cycling.
307,__label1__,The unit worked fine initially. However from day 2 on the signal drops every 20 minutes. I have to power cycle either the transmitter or receiver to get the units synced up again.
308,__label1__,"This is my second Brita pitcher. The second time around I decided to go big and it is working out ok. The problem with this company is that they seem incapable of producing a lid that fits correctly. You have to hold it in place when pouring (it doesn't fit snugly; one end always sticks up). Same thing occurred with first one I owned. And yes, they were that way right out of the package. Quality control is sorely lacking at Brita. But for the price, the filter does its job so it's an acceptable product and I will keep it."
309,__label1__,"Delicious candies, it comes very well packed, so the taste of each kind of candy was good. My only complaint is that after I purchased them, I found the same package for a better price by several dollars."
310,__label1__,I love the Yoda design but not the functionality of this bottle. But was disappointed because it leaked after several use.
311,__label1__,"I was looking this with first interest buy this ... I can not buy this because I do not trust it. Please check the pictures, and the company website. This is not for Sprint Samsung GalaxyS3 4200mAh is not showing there. From where is this information?"
312,__label1__,"This brush isn't bad for getting through tangles, although it does stick a little when you have thicker hair. When wet, it seems to be more difficult to use. All around, the brushes are pretty decent for use on your hair."
313,__label1__,"I like this product. I am in my mid twenties and really do not have any wrinkles, but I noticed that this does perk my eyes up a little and it is a great preventative for wrinkles. I trust the OZ Naturals brand!"

316,__label1__,"I'm enjoying swimming more often now compared before, i hate latex and I'll never wear one again. Silicone is the thing because it's comfortable to use, doesn't wear out easily and it's cheaper. This cap is durable and very good at keep my hair dry, I love the style as well and the toughness of the silicone. I'll be recommending it to my friends!"
317,__label1__,I carry it around with me and jot down every idea that pops into my mind whenever something comes in that I dont want to forget. Ive been able to start two small (grass roots) businesses that have come up from nothing with all ideas written down in this notebook. Thanks!
318,__label1__,Definitely does the trick I have a few friend who swear by this stuff. I'm not a big fan of the taste though
319,__label1__,"If you are going to use it for playing Counter Strike Global Offensive, like me, you can just go ahead and buy this right now!"
320,__label1__,"This is an awesome baby monitor IF you keep it plugged in constantly, it doesn't last very long off the charger and if you shut it off the monitor, you may as well just plug it in cuz if you turn it back on, it's dead. But sound quality and everything is wonderful."
321,__label1__,"I use the Pro-A Serum every other day. I apply  about a dime sized amount to my face and neck after completely washing and drying my face. It has no smell at all. It is a thicker serum, almost gel like. It absorbs well into my face and doesn't leave me feeling oily. I love the results I am getting from the Pro-A serum. My skin is tighter and more firm. It feels softer and more moisturized then it has in a long time. My lines and wrinkles are going away, and I just feel younger, knowing that my face looks better."
322,__label1__,"I had high hopes when I saw that this one was of the bestselling solar panels here. I read most of the reviews here, and decided to purchase one for my house. Once they arrived, I managed to install them and for the first day I didn't had any problem - only thing was that I noticed that panels were of low quality and fragile. Second day the charge controller broke for no apparent reason, I just saw it broken and since I couldn't fix it myself -I called support - which, by the way, was not helpful. I returned the panels and asked for a refund, because they didn't wrote in the description how fragile these were :/.<br /><br />I listened to my friend's advice, who's a solar repairman, and I bought, like he did, a Suntastic Charger ( http://amzn.to/1Ad27Vf ) which I received 4 days ago. It's strange how I never experienced any problem with these - the material was good and firm - and charger was much more practical than of the Renogy."
323,__label1__,i love this product . bec i love to video something that is hidden and this product works perfectly for me but i hope i could video more. and have a higher memory . :)
324,__label1__,I used it once.It is not 100% pure and a good quality as they said.It contains mostly water and alcohol.
325,__label1__,These are all over my house. They work for any size room and are completely mess free. Great price for a quality product.
326,__label1__,its a beard growther! little bit confused but found that is cool to use . Thinking to take this one for me.
327,__label1__,"I used this with no problem, issues, didn't drop it, etc the day before then went to use it yesterday and it will not turn on. It just literally died. They said they have no warranty. So after only 6 months of very infrequent use, just died. Would not buy again without a warranty from a company that offered one."
328,__label1__,"I wouldn't recommend this baby seat to anyone who wants a safety to his kid. Once I got it, I put it into my car, because I had to drive my kid to the kindergarten, and once I arrived, the buckle just stuck - for no apparent reason. After a 3 minute fight I managed to free my kid from a seat and it was a disappointing experience. It happened 4-5 times after, so in the end I called support and asked them for help. They didn't had concrete solution, so I returned the item and got a refund.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I bought 65LX Seat ( http://amzn.to/1xthVzA ), because a colleague who had a 6 yr old kid said he bought it too and never had any problem with it. Once I got it - a week ago - I never had any problems with buckles, and since it had positive reviews here I wondered why I didn't purchase it prior to this one."
329,__label1__,"Each luggage is perfect for everyone in my family. It is big enough and everything we need can fit on it. It is perfect for everyday get-outs or out-of-town trips. The only thing that I don't like about it is the wheels because they don't seem to be durable. I have this for 2 months already but I still don't trust the wheels. They look as if they will be broken for some time. But aside from that, everything is good already."
330,__label1__,They went out of stock in the stores nearby over night. Getting it online is the best thing to do if you don't mind waiting a little. Perfect combination of product and price too...my grandson is going to go ballistic!
331,__label1__,"I am a massage therapist and I use almond oil at my job on a daily basis. The oil really helps soothe the skin, especially when you're working with clients who are exposed to the elements a lot. I find it provides the client with a better experience overall, especially working on their backs. My ultimate forumla is to use almond oil on fair areas and jojoba oil on the rougher areas like hands, elbows, or feet. Jojoba oil is awesome- [[ASIN:B00AJFV8L6 NOW Foods Sweet Almond Oil - 16 oz. + FREE Desert Essence Pure Jojoba Oil -- 4 fl oz]]. It really helps soften the skin in those extra hard places.<br /><br />I use the stuff at home too. One dab of each oil in the morning give my hands a soft feeling throughout the day whether I'm working or not. It's great on faces and for some clients, they've told me they use it in their hair as well. The stuff is great, non-greasy, and quick to use!"
332,__label1__,I just love how this makes my skin feel and how it feels around my eyes .I don't have lines at all but there's nothing wrong with trying new products .
333,__label1__,"This is a very nice shower curtain rod. The color is a nice dark brown color. The only issue that I would caution is that the finish is painted on, and does scratch if you are not careful with your hooks/slides."

335,__label1__,"This peel is like a facial in a bottle. It is effective yet gentle. Very easy to use and gives great results. My face has a wonderful glow immediately after using this peel. A little goes a long way, too. An excellent in home peel!"
336,__label1__,"This is a good product. I have been using it exclusively for 6 months or so and saw some solid weight loss. (3-4lbs a month) I have since switched over to a product called LipoPhen which seems to work much better, and I am now seeing 7-8lbs of fat loss per month. If you are a looking for a really intense fat burner/appetite suppressant, I would check out LipoPhen [[ASIN:B00I8ULAD0 LipoPhen - Advanced Weight Loss Supplement]] or LipoDream [[ASIN:B00I8US55G LipoDream - Non-Stimulant Advanced Weight Loss Supplement and Sleep Aid]]."
337,__label1__,I'm really enjoying having a smaller hand held cheese grater. It's much easier to clean and use then my older stand up grater. I use this to grate cheese right on top of homemade pizza and salads instead of having to use the larger grater and a bowl or a plate. I also love that it is dishwasher safe and comes with a storage pouch so I don't cut my hands on it when it's in my utensil drawer.
338,__label1__,"Good quality USB cable, such as a color change indication can tell at a glance if the full load management, but also a very reasonable price, I will have a time when they do so."
339,__label1__,fairly acceptable. shaves but not as close as i'd hoped for no matter how many times i go over the area.
340,__label1__,too small! i'm only using it for my face but i hate the idea that it is too small. it doesnt smell anything bad and i actually like the feeling of it. after 3 usage with me and my wife it change texture rather quickly. i also bought another one (circular charcoal) and it degenerates rather quickly.
341,__label1__,I really enjoy using camera and the convenience of the strap for hands free. Met all my expectations and then some. Has all the features I was looking for and at a price I could afford.
342,__label1__,"Used the serum for a month and like it a lot so decided to try the eye cream too. Like how you can save a few dollars by buying the set. The serum goes on silky smooth, absorbs well and not greasy. Leaves my skin feeling hydrated and moisturized all day long. Can notice an improvement in the wrinkles too. The eye cream is very nice too. Soft and absorbs nicely into my skin. Skin around my eye area looks brighter and less wrinkly. Going to buy again."
343,__label1__,There is nothing fancy about these envelopes. They are very basic but that is all that you'll need. They have the right format for most letters and are not that expensive.
344,__label1__,"Good Product. Deep Inside, Nice & Stylish Outside!!. amazon Delivery is also very Quick. Good product @ decent Price"
345,__label1__,"This lasted a bit longer than the crackle bone I think simply because it is round.  It is made form light weight plastic and very easy to eat.  My girl and 11 month old puppy was able to eat this in under 10 minutes.  I was hoping it was harder plastic like the normal kong toys but not so.  If you have a chewer - don't waste the money.<br /><br />If your pup doesn't chew and just plays then I would say go for it.  But, if they are a chewer - they will eat it in short order."
346,__label1__,"The powder certainly smelled sweet and vanilla-like but I wouldn't describe it as a vanilla milkshake.  The fake sugar taste was really really apparent so possibly the plain variety would be better.  Although the company was really nice to send me a sample, I was disappointed and wouldn't order this."
347,__label1__,These heads do not vibrate any where near as strong as the original Philips Sonicare heads.  Not worth the savings as I had to go buy a brand name repalcement from Walmart after trying these.
348,__label1__,"The build of the bottle as a whole  is pretty solid. However, there were a few places, specifically the juicer parts where flash plastic got in the way of using the product. The build is solid and it feels good in the hand!"
349,__label1__,"This piece of junk stopped spinning exactly in the middle of me starting to smile. I mean, whoa, did this thing really just stop working just as I was enjoying the breeze? That's just rude man."
350,__label1__,"I enjoyed this towel holder, especially good for the design if your in to it like I am, it doesn't hold the really heavy towels but does the job."
351,__label1__,Love the softness of these sheets. They are so comfortable. These are a great buy for yourself or as a gift.
352,__label1__,Fantastic price for such a lovely artificial tree. This makes a great addition the ones already in my house. This tree is my new favorite!
353,__label1__,"The cooking surface is very small and the cleaning is next to impossible. If you don't attempt to clean it while its hot, you may as well throw it away. There is no temperature setting either so it cooks everything fast or it will leave burn marks on your food. I so wanted to like this product because I wanted to eat healthier but this product doesn't live up to expectations."
354,__label1__,"I have been using other expensive brands but came across this brand while shopping on Amazon, wish I had not made that huge mistake for falling for the reviews & cheap price. Within few minutes of applying this on my face my whole face broke out I mean major break out & my face turned all red and hot it's been a week now and I can still see patches of red dry skin on my face and forehead. I am absolutely positive that this is not pure argan oil , it is either mixed with sunflower oil or cut with other cheap mineral oils, I have never had this bad experience before with pure argan oil and I have been using argan oil for 2+ years now, the only time my skin would have a reaction or break out is if anything had either sesame oil or coconut oil in it or when the products contained mineral oils. We also noticed that this oil very thin compared to other expensive brands and my husband is researching this product and is trying to find a local lab so we can send this bottle to be tested to see what all stuff this oil contains."
355,__label1__,"The quality of this set of crochet hooks does not compare to previous purchases of individual hooks. I purchase an I-9 crochet hook from a crafts store pre-2000 and the quality was great. These are acceptable, but not the same. Still usable though."

357,__label1__,"I love Omega 3 supplement but the fish aftertaste is why I stop taking them.  When I saw that these didn't have a fish after taste I was excited until I discovered it did.

358,__label1__,"But this is just far too narrow. It's recommended that one should lie diagonally on a Mayan hammock but this isn't possible with this hammock. I will be returning this and then buying a ""family"" size hammock for $49 from another firm."
359,__label1__,We just bought this watch for one of my sons birthday gifts and he LOVES it. I am incredibly happy with the quality and this definitely gains the cool points with him. My husband also has this watch and wears it on weekends and it's been going strong and taking the beating of my outdoors man for a couple years now.
360,__label1__,"I've really enjoyed using this treatment from the moment it was delivered. Easy to apply, smells really nice, doesn't leave my hair feeling heavy or slimy despite the oils in it—in general, this treatment turned out to be perfect for me. It takes effect on hair regrowth after a while, but I like it so much I barely noticed the weeks fly by."
361,__label1__,"While the personal groomer works, the shaky construction quality doesn't inspire confidence. Also the brow shaper lacks a plastic guide - good luck shaving your eyebrows freehand without looking like an electrical shock victim."

The others I have don't sound very well I hope they hold up! I haven't even attempted to put together yet as I need the top shelf. Hope it's as decent as these reviews bc right now I'm not convinced.
363,__label1__,I bought this hoping i would get a day out of my battery or that maybe I could use it as a swap battery on long trips. Unfortunately the clips on the case broke on the first use. I was careful placing it in but the materials used for the case seem really cheap. I don't know about the battery yet but it won't be very useful without a case that stays on the phone.
364,__label1__,I originally bought this hairband for my daughter but when it arrived on my mail and opened. I like it and tried it myself and was happy putting it on my hair so I guess I will order more of this for myself. One for my daughter and one for myself.
365,__label1__,Installed it easily on my phone 6 days ago. It doesn't need a manual to put into the phone and looks appealing. I am not sure about hard drops at this stage but seems to work very well with soft drops on the TV stand and bedside stool. Nice one..
366,__label1__,"I wanted to love this supplement because it was organic, but apparently it is not what it used to be. I read another very informative review that stated that they changed the formula. What a shame!!!!"
367,__label1__,"It is a good value for a small low cost TV. The picture quality is best on the strongest cable channels. The colors are not vibrant on some digital cable channels. The sound quality is the weakest link. I'm hopping that once I connect runs it through the amplifier and sounds system, that the streaming video and separate sound system and speakers will make it a higher quality and more watch able part of our bedroom system."
368,__label1__,"A solid effort. Obviously with all of the books like this one, the effort you put in understanding it and how much you work on implementing what you've learned is determining how successful you are gonna be after you're done with it."
369,__label1__,"I have been looking for an inexpensive, high quality duvet insert for a few months. I almost gave up and bought one! I found this insert on my weekly trip to store! It is so light while still keeping you warm!"
370,__label1__,"Words can't describe how much I love this coffee maker. I will gladly pay the extra couple of dollars for k-cups (over bagged coffee) for the convenience and ease of this machine. It makes delicious hot coffee in 30 seconds. You can leave the coffee pod empty and it makes a hot cup of water for tea. I've also used this product to warm up baby bottles instead of boiling water. I've used my keurig at least 3 times a day for over 2 years and haven't had one problem yet. The price is high for a coffee maker, but it literally last forever. I highly recommend this product."
371,__label1__,The thermometer itself is fine but it can get really hot to the touch if you leave it close to heat for too long.
372,__label1__,nice just awesome......... jud amizing......... past is nice it must be crezy.  an i dont know what is that... but awesoem
373,__label1__,very unstrudy and not worth the money. It broke the second time I used it while trying to put it together.
374,__label1__,"a mix up in the positive/negative wiring. There is a small removable panel on the back of the solar panel and the charge controller, both easily accessible and requiring no tools, where one can simply verify that the wires are consistently connected from the positive terminal solar panel to the positive terminal controller to the positive terminal device being charged."
375,__label1__,"These brushes are too soft and very soon after your first usage you will see some of the bristles coming out. This is not worth the purchase, not falling for any generic product again."
376,__label1__,Galore for women is very nice indeed. I have been wearing this for years and recieve many compliments when I wear this. I just found the Original Monteil Body Lotions for this wonderful fragrance at www.Thefragrancefactory.com<br />They are a reputable site you can read about them in the Seattle Times at http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19991125&slug=2997567
377,__label1__,"This facial brush was great the first few months. I was very happy with it. Then every once in awhile during use it would shut off. Now when I use it, it is on for about 3 seconds, then shuts itself off and from then on it's constantly shutting itself off and I have to turn it on, again and again and again."
378,__label1__,"just bought this and wasn't expecting too much. I wanted to have laughter skin but I am not expecting to get it from this lotion, i just like the smell of this and the skin benefits. I don't know if I already got a noticeable lighter skin with this lotion, I don't notice much because I am not so focused on checking skin changes. But overall, this is really a good lotion."
379,__label1__,"I found that this eye cream irritated my eyes slightly. I think it's because it's currently winter where I live, and the climate is very cold and dry, making my eyes extra sensitive and my skin much dryer that normal. I think that caffeine in this product irritated my already sensitive eyes a bit. I normally don't have any issues with Passport to Organics products, and I have found the Zinc Eye Cream to be wonderful and very moisturizing for the winter. I look forward to giving Caffeine Eye Cream another try in the summer when my eyes are less sensitive!"
380,__label1__,"The instructions were ok, but I was lucky it went together correctly since the instructions do not label back and front of pieces. The multiple screws and parts are not labeled on the packages which also is a problem.<br /><br />Once it came together it looked great. One draw was damaged and they are sending a replacement."
381,__label1__,Needed this for a project and now the project has been scrapped because this did not perform as I needed it to. What a waste of time.
382,__label1__,I always cook spaghetti.<br />This grater works the best on grating the cheese that I place on top of spaghetti.<br />The cheese are grated just right!<br />It is also easy to clean!

386,__label1__,"My wife bought this for the celebration of my birthday party. The guests really enjoyed it while having a conversation with each other. After the party is over, it's cleaning time! The dishwasher helped burden our task. This is a must-have for every party!"
387,__label1__,"It made me scared to even try it.  Label was half torn off and syrup leaking every where.  Label looks like the picture like someone printed it off their printer at home, barely stuck it on a bottle and sent it out."
388,__label1__,The new spigen nexus 5 ultra hybrid case is a nice durable case. I like how I can change up the design of the case whenever I want. It's super easy too. The case is not too flimsy. I took off one star became I feel like the back plastic can easily get scratched. But we'll see about that. I've only had for two days so we'll see.
389,__label1__,Very interesting material but not a book that really grabbed me. Perhaps its because its not the usual kind of book I read.
390,__label1__,This is the great product.Its collar is really awesome. It is made of high quality of materials with great price. So really I loved it. The case is also dirt and shockproof.So I am confident that my iPad is more protected now. A very fantastic all-in-one case that I recommend to everyone.
391,__label1__,"the item is very poor i used it twice it has no effect at all its simply useless ,and the other thing i need a spray as its mentioned .....but it was not a spray its a liquid gel and its"
392,__label1__,"I was somewhat disappointed. The bag was not as thick or as padded as I would have liked. It serves the purpose, but lacks some useful features. More padding and more pockets or dividers would have been appreciated. Still, it is a good price and gets the job done."
393,__label1__,"I'm not sure these do much. I'm pretty sure they don't hurt anything, and it's possible my appetite was suppressed a little bit, but did not notice much of a difference in energy or weight loss. Might be better combined with other supplements for best results."
394,__label1__,Excellent quality and versatile product. You don't have to think twice about it. More vibrant in person.
395,__label1__,I really like the look of this box. My apartment is really small and I am looking for a neat way to keep things under my bed so that it stays out of the way and I can retrieve it when necessary. My concern is that I am not sure how tall this box is and I only have about 5 inches under my bed. I don't know why this product doesn't mention the height...
396,__label1__,"Nice wood blocks, but smaller than I thought they would be. My Son loves to stack & build with them tho."
397,__label1__,"The scent is amazing if you use just the right amount. The only problem is that for it to last all day when I'm at work I have to really spray a lot of it on and it's too much for a couple of hours but after I get to work the scent will taper off.<br /><br />I work in an office environment and the first day I wore it like 100 people asked me about it which is nice, but I could tell it was strong. I guess other brands are kind of the same but I think this one is like that because of the way its made and the scent even though it is amazing!"
398,__label1__,Worth the extra few bucks because it's really good quality. The cutouts are neat and the case fits the S4 well. I only wish it came with a screen protector.
399,__label1__,"The parts anchoring the handles broke the first time I use this bucket and now I'm looking at something that I wouldn't trust to clean anything with. Next time, I'm spending a little more on a bucket that can give me better service."
400,__label1__,"What a wonderful book. Sensitively written about a very sad topic. Yet the author succeeded in not making the book sad, but a wonderful depiction of a family's grief and growth. I can't believe I waited so long to read this. I will definitely read it again."
401,__label1__,"I really enjoy this camera, I take it where ever I go, it takes great pictures. And I make all my videos for my business with it. The only problem I just began to have is the battery life is not lasting like it did at the beginning, so what I am doing is constantly changing the brand of batteries to use."
402,__label1__,"Seems to perform just ok, it's a battery. Came packed well, easy to put in my Note 3, doesn't look used..it's a smidge more than batteries that say their OEM, but besides the label, there doesn't seem to be a difference."
403,__label1__,"I always wanted dreads and this IS the thing you might wanna use to get them. Really easy to use, just apply your regular hair gel on the sponge and just twist em away! Really easy to use and works beautifully. Getting dreads have never been easier. I really do recommend this!"
404,__label1__,"I saw Exposed in Boston, face out, at The Harvard Bookstore in Cambridge. Vibrant front cover, interesting premise on back cover. An unusual cast of characters, a little over the top, which is why I liked it as much as I did. A really fun read."
405,__label1__,"This organizer works great in an office setting or at home. The organizer is durable, not too heavy, and can be used standing upright or laying on its side."
406,__label1__,"Easy to put on, yes. But it's really hard to take it off once you're done with painting whatever it is that you were painting. Also, this taped doesn't stick well into uneven surfaces and especially wood."
407,__label1__,SMells really bad! Almost like rancid and old underwear.<br /><br />Do not purchase this. I can't tell if it is good on my skin or not because I can't bear the smell to even use it.
408,__label1__,I bought one of these a while back and even got one more for my oldest son. Really handy to have when you want to mix up a quick fix instead of stopping for fast food. Mine discolored a bit inside but that's more cosmetic than anything.
409,__label1__,"I knew these wouldnt be that great but I didnt think they would be THIS bad! they feel SO cheap, are WAY heavier than they should be, lost both tips the first time out, the compasses dont work and the locking mechanisms dont stay lock so you have to keep tightening them throughout your hike. What a waste."
410,__label1__,"Using this product could not be easier in keeping our pool clean, which is particularly important since my grandkids often come over during summer."
411,__label1__,"I will not buy Viva labs again. They offer to donate $10 to a charity to leave a review. WHAT???<br />How does that create honest product reviews??? How do we know they actually do that? That is just sketch. Any company that did this, I just had to look further into. Check out their Krill Oil product reviews, other customers had similar complaints about fake reviews.<br /><br />SO LOOK AT ALL FAKE THE 5-STAR REVIEWS! Why have these customers only reviewed Viva Labs products, or sometimes nothing else. It's a little bit weird when you start to look at it. The easy answer is the reviews for charity donation bribe.<br /><br />Started to look into the company. Another reviewer pointed out that they were a Kentucky corporation but were foreign owned. It is easy enough to do a google search, so I did one but I did not find a facility. I only saw the generic office park. This is some sort of shell company or something? Even more strange. Where is their location at? Where do they make this stuff and where does it come from?<br /><br />Too many weird occurances for me to put it into my body."
412,__label1__,"The author of ""Hell"" seems to recognize the need for tradition if the Bible is to have any meaning at all. Think how someone entirely unfamiliar with Judaism, Christianity and the Bible would react if he read the Bible without any guidance, for the first time, in a set of unbound pages. He likely wouldn't see in it any order or unity as a book.<br /><br />In ""How to Stop Believing in Hell"" (on the Kindle list) the narrator describes his life and slow release from spiritual terror without reliance on any religion other than the one he is abandoning. He rejects all the usual doctrines: the existence of the will, morality, the infallibility of any book or person, immortality, the existence of the soul, eternity, Heaven, Purgatory, Armageddon, and Divine judgement. Only then does he find the love of his Creator and cease to fear Hell. It's exciting reading and can be found on Kindle's list."
413,__label1__,"I personally chose the f4 version of this range because it's cheaper and it's and L lens which means the optics used are way more better and you can achieve crispier photos.<br /><br />I have a Canon Eos 7d., which is a good body for this range because given the 1.6x crop of it's sensor the equivalent range of this lens is 112-320mm 2.8. It's a perfect lens for bird photography and candid photos.<br /><br />The aperture for me is not an issue because you can still produce a BOKEH when in f4.. not much but its okay.. I also tried the 70-200 f2.8 and it's way more better. It's a good telephoto lens for the price.."
414,__label1__,Didn't work for me! Not even a little bit! Someone told me about another body slimming wrap so I decided to try it out. I didn't think it would do anything but to my surprise it really worked! I use them frequently now! I got them at [...]  Hope this helps
415,__label1__,This product company say it that it is a very good cream. But it didn't work properly. I just hate it.
416,__label1__,Didn't work on either of my schnauzers. Not even a little. We won't be buying from this company ever again!
417,__label1__,"I've had a previous version of this and it plays so much better. the only thing this has over the u818a was that the camera is better, but not 30 dollars better."
418,__label1__,Good ergonomics and cuts well. We'll see how well it stays sharp. I expect it to be superior than most other clippers.
419,__label1__,"These are just as pictured and go well with a cobalt blue pitcher I already owned .Not fine crystal, but very nice. Good size for water, vodka, soft drinks"
420,__label1__,"The product is great and easy to install .<br />Works fine, I dont think there are anything missing in the price it is offered at."
421,__label1__,I received this rug today and I absolutely love it. Looks a little brighter than the picture but is exactly what I wanted. Perfect for our front entrance way.
422,__label1__,"Love the brand!  The Vitamin C serum feels great on my face!  The only problem with the product is the container! When you pump it serum out, It has a powerful squirt and goes all over!  I love the product!!"
423,__label1__,I and this ipad cover are long lost buddies and we united a few months back.I am availing this covers services to the fullest as it just seems indestructible.<br />I have a lot of my designing on the ipad as I am an interior designer and I can't afford a single scratch on this but my kids are so rough with my gadget that I am usually running around to keep it safe but this case helped me through it.
424,__label1__,It doesn't work as you said. Maybe I'm doing. Something wrong It looks easy watching TV. and other person. Ding for you too. Plus I have very bad shoulder so is not that easy as I thought.
425,__label1__,Read this book before you travel. There are lessons to be learned from Fatal Sunset. Very good research and writing and lots of eye-opening examples of how vacations can turn deadly in the blink of an eye.
426,__label1__,"This vitamin C serum is easy to use with the pump. I don't care for the smell but it is light. It soaks in fast and does a good job to brighten my skin, I didn't think I could ever find a serum like this that wasn't oily but it isn't. It does leave my skin soft. I very much like the results which I would give a 5 but only for the smell I gave it a 4."
427,__label1__,Fantastic assortment and easy to switch between tools. I keep one in my bag at all times and a spare for later use.
428,__label1__,Great value for the price.  Perfect earplug for traveling/sleeping because I travel most of the time. and It has nice little case.
429,__label1__,"I am a Keurig fanatic. The K-cups are a staple of my house. I find it very convenient especially in the morning because I am notorious for running late. K-cups make it really easy to measure and be on the run. Green tea is my favorite flavor and bigelow is amongst my favorite brand. I find these cups to be flavorful and not dull like so many alternatives. I also appreciate that it's not sweetened to death like some green teas.<br /><br />There are always those mornings where a little extra flavor can't hurt. Adding a dash of green tea powder {[[ASIN:B009PICJTS All Natural Organic Instant Green Tea Powder 8 oz. - Buy One Get One Free!]]} gives me the extra hit I'm looking for as well as a jolt of natural energy. I much prefer tea to coffee or other stimulants. Plus I don't have any crash which is always important. I don't need the extra always, but it's nice to have it and be able to add it accordingly without challenge."
430,__label1__,"After using this for a few months, I can tell that my abs are slowly starting to come back.  I've been working hard to lose some weight and get back to the shape I was in in college.  After taking some supplements and using this I feel Great!"
431,__label1__,"I like this case alot because of its style, kind of reminds me of a spider. Im not into spiders but how cool it looks on my iphone. I also think the box looks cool with its hologram logo and luxury style box. The cover too a bit time to figure how to install it onto my iphone but thats the only complaint I have."
432,__label1__,"It's been a week since I ordered RC Helicopter for my kid. (to be fair, I also love these things :)), and once I received it, I showed it to my kid and he was excited and told me that he wants to see it when it flies. So I got a joystick and saw that it doesn't receives any signal from helicopter. Firstly, I thought that it's because of batteries, logically, but the batteries were in, so I was confused. I told Amazon what I got and they said that I return the item and choose new one, because this one was out of stock :((.<br /><br />I choose another Helicopter which was far more better, It's Mini Radio RC Helicopter (http://amzn.to/12NArYx) which is cool and which worked from the first time I bought it :). In the end, my kid was happy to see it on air, so I was also :))."

436,__label1__,I feel like I am using an exercise tubeband when I walk my dogs with this. It is hard to pull them back onto the sidewalk when they wander off onto the grass. We just wish that it was longer.

438,__label1__,"I warned my friend as the reviewers here warn other customers. If you don't want your pets to die from poison, you should stay away from this."
439,__label1__,The product was well packaged and easy to assemble. I ordered three and all were complete and make a great addition to our study and a good way to display our collectables.
440,__label1__,"Working well here, good price for what you get.  The output quality of this rather good.  Laser printers sure beat inkjets when it comes to consumables."

In my first week I managed to drop 5 pounds and I was very excited because I thought I'd found my miracle pill. The week after that I actually gained 3 of those pounds back even though I was doing the exact same routine. The third week I've managed to lose 4 more pounds from where I was in week 2. It's hard to say if I'm going to get consistent results from these at this point. I'm going to go ahead and finish off the bottle and possibly try another one. For now I'm giving it 3/5 because it's clearly working and helping me lose weight, I just can't figure out why it fluctuates so damn much."

The cotton sheets I have been buying will shrink after a few washings making it difficult to put the fitted sheet on the bed. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because they do not breathe like cotton and we have found them a little warm to sleep in. Other than that they are very nice sheets."
447,__label1__,"This is a great kit to use to remove your blackheads on your nose. It works perfectly, and it is what they used to remove your blackheads professionally! It is worth the buy, and I am very satisfied with my purchase, and my nose is now clear of blackheads after usage of this remover kit :)."
448,__label1__,"Decent printing paper.  If you are looking for something cheap, then this will do the job. You get exactly what you think you're getting.  Its a little on the heavier side, so it will jam my printer once in awhile, but other than that, its fine."
449,__label1__,"I feel that the ratings of this book aren't fair. I mean, yes, it's not the top of the literature but it's a very decent novel and the story is good. I give it four stars."

454,__label1__,"The packaging on this product could be much better.. The box was delivered to our home, and it was very..... Loose. The pieces inside were definitely not as secure as you would like. So there was one piece that has a tiny scratch on it. And I'm only mentioning it because it's on the outside in the center of the crib. But other than that, the instructions were great, and it was very easy to put together. I did it by myself, couldn't wait till my husband got home."

Now all I see is a black picture with a sound? This doesn't has any sense, I contacted support and they were mesmerized, so I returned the item.<br /><br />I bought a similar TV by Samsung (http://amzn.to/1Bb6nSa), and the picture was good. However I never received an answer about what happened with previous TV, but it was something fishy :/, I guess it was malfunctioned...maybe."

It is a very effective product.    That said, I do like using this. It creates a lot of heat and perspiration. That has meant some loss of weight already, although I wonder if this is simply water, rather than the fat we are promised. Will return after more time and report my final findings. All in all, a recommended product, just make sure to use properly."

So I'm giving this 4 stars and will update to 5 if my results continue even without nutrition (I don't like changing what I eat). In any case, so far I've lost a good amount of weight and my stomach definitely looks better.<br /><br />P.S. For the one reviewer who didn't like some of the other reviews here. I bought this product on the baladea website and reviewed it since I always review my purchases here. It's not very nice to call people dishonest without any evidence. I recommend you try the product and write a comment based on that."

That being said, I feel like this one size fits all thing is not working, every time I keep finding myself pulling up the waist since it likes to sag down a bit. It has become very annoying since short skinny girls will not be able to do any good exercise like they want to. Forget about running, you will find yourself like one of those saggy pants guys that have no belts. The texture is okay but not great, surely not for the price. In the mean time I will be looking at other better designed leggings"

We are active people in our late 40's and we are always looking for ways to make us healthy.  We have read a lot about what to look for an this company, Real Spirit, put on the Internet that the machine was top of the line at a low price.  We bought it based on this information and after trying it we stopped using it because of the lack of results.  A friend of my  Wife's was over the other day and when we were talking, this subject came up.  He showed us a bunch of negative stuff online and we realized we fell for this scam.  He also showed us some other company's products and said they were certified by a USA water quality company and there were several companies like this that guaranteed their products.  Watch out for this company Air, Water and Life and boycott them."

502,__label1__,"Loved Ender's game. Probably one of the best book's I've read. So when I saw this in a store i thought - great, I could get to read on about Ender and his battles.  However, in order for this book to make some sense, the author had to rework the plot into the plot of Ender's Game, though it was not intented to be in it from the start. For instance, Bean states that during the great battles on Eros, he had to know where every ship was in order to be able to take over if Ender collapsed. However, in Ender's Game, Ender clearly states that the one who had overcontrol over half the fleet was Alai, who was almsot as good as Ender, according to Ender himself. In order to solve this discrepency, the author had Bean state that his performance was reduced because he had to do his part in the battles and also udnerstand the overall strategy, which explains his mediocre performance. In my opinion, this was just the author making excuses.  Not a terrible book, just not a very good one, especially considering how good Ender's Game was. The author would have madea far better job if he had written a book involving Bean five years after the events of Ender's Game, and not relive them from Bean's perspective."

I purchased this based on the item description, which says that it works with all major cell phone companies in the US, with some listed exceptions. T-Mobile is a major cell phone company, and its network is not one of the exceptions listed. I installed it in my attic, powered it up, then spent a LONG time trying to figure out why it had no effect at all on my phone's reception. Turns out T-Mobile 4G is on a different bandwidth, though you have no way of knowing that from the description of the product on Amazon's site. (T-Mobile's 2G does work with this product.) I purchased from ANTOnline (there are different sellers for this product, depending on when you happen to buy). ANTOnline refused to give me a return RMA until Amazon intervened, and even then they took out a 15% restocking fee, which was just theft. In the process of figuring out how this technology works I talked to T-Mobile, and they sent me a free booster that actually works with their 4G network. Having tried both (Wilson's on the 2G, TMobile's on 4G) I have to conclude that Wilson's technology is falling behind: T Mobile's product is wireless (between the antenna and unit) and it was easy to install. Wilson's requires a cable between the two, and took hours to install."

552,__label1__,"This gerber multitool is a great toy for me! My wife purchased this for a Christmas gift, and I don't think I've been this excited over something so simple! The sheath is very well designed, with a ""rubber"" loop that can be attached/re-attached without taking your belt off. My preference is to put it on the Shoulder strap of my camelback (it's my new fishing buddy) for easy access. I've used every aspect of this multi tool, and it's worked great for repairing a crab pot, for taking fish hooks out of their toothy mouths, and even cutting wire. I've used the saw to cut smaller pieces of wood, have used the screw drivers, can opener, botle opener, knife and scissors without any challenges.<br /><br />The flashlight (neatly and firmly attached to the sheath) is what you would expect from a one AAA light...not long life but if used as a true back up light or for limited bursts, it will last a few months. The firesteel is awesome, as long as you have time to play with it and figure out which technique works best for you. I've started a couple of fires with it now, and through trial and error, I've learned to scrape the black finish off the steel with the file, ""rough"" the steel surface up with the file edge (it really helps to create better spark), and to vary pressure, speed and angle of striker to maximize the sparks.<br /><br />Once that was all figured out, it's become kind of a magic trick! I've been asked why not just use a lighter. Well, I can, but it's not nearly as much fun, and not rewarding at all!<br /><br />Pricy? perhaps... but to me, it's already paid for itself and then some!"

563,__label1__,"it's functional, is sturdy and does what it says it will do. Easy to use, clear instructions. but it's not worth the price."
564,__label1__,Moringa is such a great herbs that gives multi benefits but it is spoiled when not properly manufactured with high quality purify process. I bought this product based on the advertisements made and it turned out all of them are false claims. Powder is not fresh and dirt present in it. I spoke to the manufacturer and their employees were not able to confirm any of the claims listed in this advertisement. Such a bad experience fooled by these people who utilize the online community.
565,__label1__,"We purchased this ottoman to replace a coffee table. The size is very good for a full size sofa. The stitching was aligned well. The color was a very nice grey, I was very happy with it. Our main focus was to have storage for pillows and throws. I don't think that it would be good seating for adults, but children would be fine. Overall for the price, I was quite pleased."
566,__label1__,"Wow, this product is a lot bigger than I expected! You really get your moneys worth. I use this on my hair once or twice a week and it leaves my hair feeling sleek and silky all day."
567,__label1__,I'm satisfied with this read although I wasn't too impressed with the facts. Surely this isn't a history book but I do feel it's a bit blank on some reliable facts but still a good story.
568,__label1__,This has a lot of practice exams which was enough for me to prepare myself for the exams in less than 3 months. Good overall.
569,__label1__,I don't like Pamper's wipes because they stretch and seem flimsy. I also feel that they do not clean well and seem slippery when trying to wipe. I seem to go through a lot just to get clean.
570,__label1__,These are perfect for sitting on the porch and enjoying your morning coffee. However they were not the easiest to put together. The holes that are pre-drilled were not lined up correctly making the chair unstable so we had to red rill the holes on our own.
571,__label1__,"I was happy with this purchase but I certainly was a little shocked at how small it was when compared to the image online.  My husband and I drink a lot of wine and have a Tuscan-style look in our kitchen and have other win-related items for decor.  Overall, great decorative item but I wish I had a better way to determine size ahead of time."
572,__label1__,This product is okay if all you're looking for is a hot beverage in the morning. I was very disappointed in the lack of real coffee flavor. Will not buy again.
573,__label1__,I originally bought the Magna-tiles for my 6 year old who loves puzzle so I thought that maybe he'd also be interested in this set. Turns out all of my kids loved it so I had to buy a few more sets. I guess they love the colors and they way they can build different 3-d things with them.
574,__label1__,"Does what it is supposed to do, what more can you ask for?<br /><br />Depends on your needs, but if it does everything you want it to no need to spend more on something else."
575,__label1__,"I have turned to baking as a hobby. When I saw this online I ordered one immediately. I am happy to say the unit works as advertised. But still a 4, because I was a bit disappointed with the delivery."
576,__label1__,What a scam this battery was sent to me dead charged my phone all night on it and the second you took it off it died took it into Verizon thinking was something wrong with my phone nope the battery had no polarity bought a new one and voila no problems dollar amt was too small to justify return shipping. Total scam
577,__label1__,I like and enjoy this product. I thought it would have been a little longer but it is alright. I was also caught by surprise with opening of the seat. I like that secret compartment.
578,__label1__,"This movie is about a extraterrestrial race that is forced in some kinds of ghettos.<br />Most people state that they love this movie but i cannot share this excitement.<br /><br />For me this movie was kind of boring, don't know why this movie didn't attract me."
579,__label1__,I also believe the Q's will be more durable. The plastic headband on the Solo's breaks WAY TO EASY! Stay away from the hype and get this better product. My only complaint is the length of the cords.
580,__label1__,"It is a nice little travel guide that helped me to prepare for my trip to Sochi, it is all in English with some useful maps that explain where is what, incl. the olympic venues. I recommend it to anybody who wants to visit Sochi, the region or the 2014 olympics."
581,__label1__,"I have been using this teeth whitening for 3 days and am seeing NO results at all. Also the gel that I'm currently using has begun to get hard already and won't come out of the tube! theo the tube is leaking..... (I keep the cap on tight) I feel no tooth sensitivity and see not even a little whitening results. my gums hurt however. I do it for an hour every day, with the light the first 15 minutes. How do I know if I got a bad batch? Very disappointed :(."
582,__label1__,"Had four DirecTV devices, needed to expand to five, this worked right out of the box with no issues whatsoever."
583,__label1__,"These are very nice everyday casual watches. I would purchase this item again, if they had a larger variety of colors. The stone sparkle very nicely. I well-constructed rubber watch. Hope it last!!"
584,__label1__,"Sadly, I feel very disappointed. First of all, product was really horrible. It responded after almost a minute of usage and it pissed me off. It can't read the card correctly so i have to swipe it multiple times with minutes of delays. To be honest, I'd not really recommend this to anyone else. I think your money should be spent elsewhere. Please avoid this...."
585,__label1__,"For the price, this is a good tablet. Kindle Fire is better in the long run and has more to offer to it! Both are great, but I would recommend the Kindle Fire over Blackberry Playbook."
586,__label1__,The size of this belt was a little smaller than I thought so I had to take it back. It's well made and very handsome.
587,__label1__,Since I got this case everyone I speak on the phone tells me my voice comes as if I'm inside of a can and too far away. I just made a call without the case and I was told my voice was crystal clear.
588,__label1__,"I purchased this product a little over 5 months ago and hardly noticed a difference... Some people that purchase weight loss items continue with their unhealthy lifestyle while using the product, but I did not. After losing a close family member to weight related issues last year, I decided to change my life for the better.<br /><br />I purchased Slim Fast after hearing great reviews from others online and in my community. I fully trusted their opinions and had high hopes for this product. I purchased it and hoped that within a few weeks, paired with an active lifestyle, that I would notice some sort of results. Two weeks passed, three, four and even six weeks later I hadn't even lost 5 pounds! If you have struggled with weight like I have, you can understand how frustrating this can be. After my experience, I really question the good reviews this product has, I have no idea how people believe this product works in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />So naturally, what did I do? I decided I had to find something else that worked. I wasn't going to let the failure of this product keep me from reaching my goal of losing 50 lbs. I searched and searched, did my due diligence and finally settled on a product that I believed gave me the best chance of reaching my goal.<br /><br />It has been three months and I have lost 42 pounds since giving up on Slim Fast and I don't regret it! I'm going to reach my goal well before the end of the month and I couldn't be happier! I have never felt so good and relieved in my life. I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long trying so many different products to still be unhappy and overweight.<br /><br />If you have went through the same emotional toll I have and need something that will get you results you need, USE THIS PRODUCT -----> http://amzn.to/1kIihbC. It is available here on Amazon and will change your life, I promise.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed. I am a walking and living example of the fact that this product works and helped me through the hardest time of my life. I hope this helps at least a few people who have struggled with weight throughout their lives."
589,__label1__,"I am very happy with my purchase it arrived just as expected. It is very well made and arrived quickly. I would recommend. Easy to put together. A big hit all around! Easy to put together, only took a couple of minutes."
590,__label1__,The bumper got dirty very fast and dirt goes inside the case like crazy. I'm tired of cleaning this case all the time so finally I gave up.
591,__label1__,"Proper serving for most kids. Most kids get enough water/juice from 1 cup full at a time.Highly recommended for any parent, day care owner."
592,__label1__,"I got these for my little ones because of the price. They are not microwave safe but they do fine in the dishwasher. Work just fine for us, you get what you pay for."
593,__label1__,"Purchased as a gift for a college-bound granddaughter. Suitcase is attractive and easily identifiable. A good feature is the TSA digital lock which provides at least a small modicum of security. I think she will like it. I have no comment on the quality as it has not been used yet, but it seems sturdy."
594,__label1__,Please stay away from this product gave me and my wife both massive headaches. She ordered this and hope we get a return. I just want to warn others.
595,__label1__,"My husband and I loved this set out of all the sets we looked at so we decided to purchase it. When we got home to put the crib together, it had a defective piece which was the threading on the right side panel hole was stripped and a screw wouldn't fit in there."
596,__label1__,"Love the fact that they have the silicone bases, first and for most and also that they are stainless steel, and also Wolfgang puck! The only drawback is that the lids are difficult to put on and take off. More so the putting on"
597,__label1__,"Ok so here are my pros and cons, all and all I will give this 4 stars based on the products ability and use.<br /><br />Pro:<br />Large chamber to hold the spice in.<br />Pleasing look and very classy looking.<br />People said theres doesnt grind evenly but mine does.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I just have one really big con which is that it takes 6, yes 6!! Triple A batteries to run it.  Over time that would get expensive if I had not of gone to dollar tree, even then it will still rack up eventually, would be great if it was a mixture of crank and battery power, so when you are tired just use the batteries."
598,__label1__,My crib was out of stock for some time and this was my last resource. I didn't only get it the day promise but it was in great conditions and great style since then its been in great use by my little angel!
599,__label1__,"Does what it is supposed to do. Wish the corners were a little sharper so the round can butt up to the edge, but the tiny rounded corners do not affect the precision of the gage. With that said, I wouldnt use this as a go-no go gage for precision case trimming of rounds. There are better methods out there."
600,__label1__,"This item does exactly what we wanted it to do, only problem is the adhesive it comes with is weak. We ended up screwing it into the wall."
601,__label1__,"I really wanted this to work, but it just didn't. Unless your cucumber/zucchini/carrot is very large this won't spiralize it, it will just decimate your produce. It's kind of cheap feeling too, one of the metal supports on the side popped off during washing."
602,__label1__,Ever since I got a Rottweiler I knew the importance of training him regularly. I bought the collar as an additional training tool but as soon as I started using it I realized I would never need anything else. My dog started to respond quicker to my commands and behaved himself when he met stranger. The collar works like a charm and if it's good enough to train a male Rottweiler it should be good enough for all other breeds.
603,__label1__,"As an old BB user, I was expecting more from the new BB Q10, but I am a bit disappointed now.<br />PROS:<br />-nice design<br />-nice keyboard<br />-good display<br />-16GB and 4G<br /><br />CONS:<br />-low battery life<br />-takes forever to boot<br />-slow in different common operations (ie: opening the Contacts list)<br />- materials of which it is made are cheaper compared to the old models<br />- bad pictures quality"
604,__label1__,"I was hoping to increase the amount of vigor in my workout. This did not help me to do that, in fact I even felt a little bit more lethargic. It was a shame because I was hoping that it would give me more power to do more with my body. I will stick to drinking redbull, rockstar, monster kind of energy drinks because that's the only thing that works for me."
605,__label1__,"I highly advise this product, this is a great accessory for me an I think for all the game lovers, who can't see the burning PS4 and want to cool that."
606,__label1__,"This book was easy to read and digest. I would recommend it , if you have some passion for stock market."
607,__label1__,We put the battery in right when we got it and it didn't work. changed it with a diff one and it still doesn't work. Will be returning it.
608,__label1__,"Just started on this supplement to help with seasonal allergies, seems to help a bit. Will keep using and see"
609,__label1__,"The quality of the quilt is great but the color was not what I wanted. The picture looks aqua , but it is actually a light green. I bought a king and unlike most King spreads it actually hangs over the sides of the bed s bit. This is a nice bedspread, nice weight and quality."
610,__label1__,The sides are not straight and bended. The back scratches easily. For this price there are tons of other cases that are made better quality.
611,__label1__,"Don't bother buying this cutting machine, because you'll end up with wasting a good money on something that cannot be repaired. Once I got the package, I wanted to install the machine via internet updates, and after I connected (hardly) online I download the latest software, but the problem was not in that. The problem was that, in every 20 minutes, machine goes off for no apparent reason. The worst thing is that the Silhouette repair center DOESN'T EXIST. so no one could repair this machine. I ended up as returning this item to Amazon...<br /><br />Once I got a refund, I bought Cricut Explore ( http://amzn.to/13Njs94 ) cutting machine which was far more better than Silhoutte version. I didn't had any problems in installing it and the fact that it comes with battery that last for 2-3 hours is really something that beats Silhouette version :)."
612,__label1__,These stories are from the heart - and are like sitting with a cup of tea and chatting with a friend. Touching and supportive.
613,__label1__,"This is the same line that my boyfriend said before. I'm sure, he will be happy to have this. The statement is very well written and the fabric is soft. I was tempted to wear it and I felt that it was comfortable. I can't wait to give it to him."
614,__label1__,"The quality of this product is poor . I'm glad it was cheap, because it's way too much in shipping to send this thing back.This is listed as an women's apron, there is no possible it would fit an adult. If i would get this on me, it would tie Around my breasts not around my waist.I should have read all the reviews, but at least all i lost was $4"
615,__label1__,I bought another one. I researched toasters and based on the reviews I bought it. It toasts unevenly at all setting light to dark. I hate when a third or more of a bagel or slice of toast is not toasted or very light.
616,__label1__,"Doctor tested? What does that even mean? It's not worth your money. Buy your turmeric from a reputable source. This company? Just ask yourself, have you ever heard of them?"
617,__label1__,"Good watch..kids will love it... looks are good, features are also sufficient for kids.<br />ideal for kids above 12years."
618,__label1__,"This case is not an oversell, it provides what it says it does.<br />Protects phone from scratches, damage when dropped, locks it in place when clipped to the belt, easy access even when it's inside the case, kickstand for easy hands-free video calling and more.<br />Im impressed because most products advertise over the top and don't really deliver what they promise.<br />Stalion does."
619,__label1__,Bought this to try with my body wash and it works great. Sponge is still in great shape after many uses and I will buy another when this finally wears out. Soft enough to use all the time.
620,__label1__,"A real nice hoop and professional looking but the backboard isn't very durable. The first I purchased, the backboard snapped within a month. I purchased another one. Same thing! I made another purchase a year later."
621,__label1__,"the food that comes out of this grill is so delicious, most of the time we use on weekends in the backyard and all the family gets united, that's what it is for. we cook, chicken, basically all types of meats. one of the best thing about the grill is that the smoke doesn't get so spread around like others because it has the cover on top, and it doesn't let so much smoke come out.<br /><br />one disadvantage and i personally think is one of the most important, the weight, it weight a lot and it is because of all the things that come included in it, like the slide burner and the holders on the side, but most definitely is one of the best grills in the stores, and market.<br /><br />the grill works with gas of course, which is good because the grills that work with carbon, make too much mess, is as if you had a stove in your own backyard or whatever place you'll use it.<br /><br />the little wheel on the bottom allows you to move it from any place to anywhere very easily."
622,__label1__,I am a teacher and the kids love the different colors of pencils. It motivates them to do their homework because its one of the prizes that we give out.
623,__label1__,Both cases I got cracked in the same spot above the camera. Since the case is like paper thin it doesn't withstand any sort of impact.
624,__label1__,I was pleased when I received this Iron.This iron is very good for the price. It presses well enough.
625,__label1__,For a short term weight loss - yes this is helpful. But what you need is to change the whole food consumption and this book won't really help you with that.
626,__label1__,These toothbrush heads fit too loosely on the Sonicaire toothbrush causing excessive vibration which is pretty painful.
627,__label1__,"Very well put together, awesome graphic. It rides really smooth. Im able to ride this to work and not feel like my back is broke when I get there."
628,__label1__,I don't think my feet stinks (I hope) but this was really refreshing and dries relatively quickly. My foot feels less moist after using this. Will recommend for those with slightly sweaty feet.
629,__label1__,"My rug is thick, comfortable, and does not shed but it does slide on hard wood floors, so you may need to order a pad as well. The color is a clean white and goes elegantly with our furniture."
630,__label1__,"First it was noisy and really lets you know that it's in the room, then it just went caput. At least, that's what my friend told me a few months after I gave it to her."
631,__label1__,The fan is very quiet which is nice and we aren't worried about our toddlers sticking their fingers inside the vent and getting hurt. I wish that it had a more powerful air output though.
632,__label1__,"My son asked for this subwoofer on his birthday, so I bought it for him. He seems to like it so far, so that’s money well spent. I just don’t understand why he wanted it in the first place though. I don’t even know what it does."
633,__label1__,It was nice to find something cheap at a fast ship place. The quality of product and receipt of merchandise is ok as wished. I should have paid attention before and ordered these cable.
634,__label1__,"A great bargin and also very nice. I loved the color, size and quality. Soft & absorbant. I recommend this to all."
635,__label1__,I did a lot of searching before settling on this bag. It's made of beautiful sturdy leather which also smells great. It's just the right size - the step is plenty long and I've had lots of compliments already.
636,__label1__,This stuff did not make me feel so hot. I felt really queasy and high like I was on drugs. I hope there is nothing bad in here.
637,__label1__,I receive so many compliments on these glasses. I have a small face but they look & feel great. The only drawback is they are made of cheap plastic. Would pay more for better quality.
638,__label1__,"My son received one of these for his birthday recently, sure enjoys it.  Does well in climbing over obstacles.  Worth it."
639,__label1__,"I needed an armband to carry my S4 while running. But the store prices are about $29.99. This one looked great for a fraction of price, and I am happy to say the armband mostly stands up to what it says in the description. The strap is not very long - so it is a little tight for large arms. But the make and looks are superb. I would recommend this in a heartbeat."
640,__label1__,OMG these things are so loud. The one I started with was whirling and grinding like I was at a construction site!
641,__label1__,"my falls of when i get to bumpy roads in the woods and the whole thing falls off as well, but its decent enough to be handled on smooth roads.."
642,__label1__,I've had the Pocket Hose a full month and it has done everything it says with no problems. Satisfied.I like it.
643,__label1__,They really help keep the dirt out of the house just please know they are not soft but they are not uncomfortable to step on. They are very nice for the money.
644,__label1__,"Complete waste of money!!!! Don't buy this to get rid of any smell in your car. All the reviews I really wonder anyway I have no time to get a refund, I threw it in the trash."
645,__label1__,"I had high hopes when I ordered this set of binoculars. I recently read reviews and saw mostly positive ones, so I decided to get one for myself. Once I got them I noticed a hard focus - I couldn't set a proper distance, one which would be proper for my eyesight and binoculars. The more troubling problem was that there was some scratch inside the optics, so every object around me looked fuzzy. This was really a hard disappointing experience for me, so I asked for a refund.<br /><br />However I bought a Bushnell Binoculars (http://amzn.to/13xDW5q), because of a friendly suggestion. There were more practical and the fact that they are waterproof really changed my ways of using binoculars :)."
646,__label1__,I am so happy with these glasses. They will be great outdoors and are heavy enough that the wind will not tip them.
647,__label1__,Comfortable to wear not to tight. Good item to have for beginner who in the kitchen that are scare to cut themselves.
648,__label1__,"You will be pleasantly surprised to learn of the excellent engineering standard of this product. Really, rather good."
649,__label1__,"I get a very good signal, less disconnects than my older PCI based Netgear adapter. I like the fact that this is USB. The chipset is RealTek, so compatibility is there. I'm using W7 64bit. The antenna is thinner than the picture, but no big deal."
650,__label1__,I use this as my &#34;survival&#34; tool on all my hikes. It gives me great peace of mind knowing that I will be able to take care of myself if I get lost or stranded. Plus this company is based from right here in Portland Oregon! Doesn't get much more local than that!
651,__label1__,"THREE things turned me off & resulted in me buying a COMPETITORS PRODUCT:<br /><br />1.  Water isn't pumped up to the TOP of the filter like COMPETITOR PRODUCTS.  Several reviewers compensate for the top of the filter being dry by rotating it 180º each time they fill the jug.  This wouldn't be necessary IF there was a pump that pumped water from the tank to the TOP of the filter.<br /><br />2.  The CONSENSUS of reviewers was UNFAVORABLE in terms of CUSTOMER SERVICE & PARTS<br /><br />3.  HOT AIR is on the ceiling & cooler air is on the floor.  This unit blows air HORIZONTALLY, instead of vertically.  COMPETITOR PRODUCTS blow the air vertically."
652,__label1__,"It is a good to prevent your phones form water, it's great for my Iphone 6 which I recently got on my birthday from my parents, after using it I can say this is the most genuine thing to prevent my phone."
653,__label1__,"I gave this bathrobe to my son as a gift. He is a young bachelor and appreciates it very much. The feel of the bathrobe is okay, not great, not the finest terry. However, it serves its purpose and should hold up for a while. It was a good buy."
654,__label1__,"I really wasted money on this product. I had a friend of mine order it since she said that they were great, but when hers and my order arrived they barely worked. Now, they're just hanging there, looking rather forlorn and useless."
655,__label1__,"These work pretty good. When I was doing my photo shoot last week, I decided to use these instead of my Opteka reflectors.  And guess what?  They work about the same, except the Neewer reflectors are a whole lot cheaper.  And the way they direct the light on my models when I'm shooting is wonderful.  I was taken by the first photo, and I expect to be using these for a long time.  The only thing I hate is fooling with the zipper on the tote bag.  It's not faulty; you just have to take your time to line the zipper up and it will work every time.  So, if you want professional quality reflectors at an affordable price, these are it."
656,__label1__,"if you need a table that is extremely durable, can be used in a multitude of ways and will last you a very long time. This is the table to get!"
657,__label1__,I have purchased many mosses baskets over the years for my friends having a baby. while I loved the hood this one offered the quality was poor. i would not feel safe having anyone put a baby in this.
658,__label1__,Got this Garcinia cambogia for two months as prescribed. There was no positive effect of any kind.<br />Wasted period along with cash. They assure a good deal but fail to deliver very poorly
659,__label1__,I buy these pads to use as puppy potty pads for my 2 small dogs but these tend to come apart when I used for my puppies. I prefer the green or blue ones over these. They are small and not real absorbent.
660,__label1__,"I am not really reviewing this product entirely for its quality. Every quality has a price that it can justify. And this set of 3 styluses at like $2 is just what you get. A cheap quality product which does its job, well most of the time at least. Had I paid a slightly higher amount, rating would have been lower. Don't expect a long-lasting or high quality stylus here. I use it only sparingly so I'm quite fine with the quality."
661,__label1__,"The shipping was not good, but the head board looks just like the picture, very pleased. we are using this head board in are spare bedroom, the assembly was very easy to assemble and the quality was good."
662,__label1__,"I bought this cute wallet for my niece on her 15th birthday, so my wife helped me to find this wallet. Glad that I found it and gave this to my niece, she was very happy with her new wallet. To be honest this wallet is attractive, but this wallet is for a teenager only."
663,__label1__,"I have done a review of the pen, which my wife says works as she hoped, elsewhere. I can't comment on the functionality of these refills as it has not been necessary to use."
664,__label1__,So happy with this vacuum for the price I purchased it for. I have thick carpet that easily gets things embedded into it and this vacuum easily cleaned it all up! Also does hard floors as well and has attachments! I love it
665,__label1__,"When I first purchased this product, I was under the assumption it would be a great teething toy for my 6 month old girl.  The toy had a variety of shapes and contrasting colors sure to keep my child occupied for a while.  After a few weeks of playing with the toy, I realized my baby didn't have much interest in it anymore.  First of all, the toy requires more motor skills than most 6 month olds have.  The squeaky ball sometimes gets stuck and makes it hard to push the squeaker.  The toy is also real heavy, and I'm concerned it will fall on my child's face when she's lying down trying to play with it.  Her foot also gets stuck between the bars when she's really active. The paint on the caterpillar started coming off by the time she reached 8 months old.  It's okay to use if your child is actually interested in it and able to maneuver it. However, it seems that by the time your child is actually old enough to do the toy some justice, all interest in playing with it is gone.  As far as a teething toy is concerned, I would have rather invested in a rattler."
666,__label1__,"We purchased this faucet after reading all the reviews, and we're very satisfied so far with its performance. The installation wasn't as simple at all."
667,__label1__,"Decent, have had pretty good tracking with this.  Wouldn't say it's anything fancy but working is good for the price."
668,__label1__,"This baby is pretty good once you get it running, but it does come with a few issues. It took a while to setup and get used to, but I can say that about a lot of products, so whatever. Still, I hate having to be patient since I have no patience."
669,__label1__,So bad experience. Got defected unit and they got the return and inspected the unit said it was not defected unit. I was very unhappy because they did not check it specifically. When I told them the symptom they said they do not have the item anymore. Also I had hard time to get refund for my extra shipping cost and original shipping cost.
670,__label1__,Cheaply made product - NOT leather at all. The magnetic flap doesn't stay closed properly increasing the likelihood of the phone flying out of the case while it's on your belt. This case is not even worth $5. Do not buy. Returning the case is another nightmare with this hole in the wall company.
671,__label1__,"I thought this would be a good investment a couple months ago, but I was wrong...<br /><br />The first main issue I noticed with this set is that the bolts tend to loosen during use and when it happened to me, part of the frame bent because it wasn't supported properly anymore.<br /><br />The parts seem too cheap to be on a machine that costs $500+, which makes me even wonder why it costs so much. Not only that, but it is also very loud during use and smells like a chemical plastic spell.<br /><br />After I had to deal with this, I did some research and found an home gym I was more confident would be better and exactly what I was looking for. Luckily it has been the best machine I've ever used to work out with!<br /><br />It doesn't have any of the issues I mentioned above and I can't find a thing to complain about in over a month!<br /><br />I got it here on Amazon too -----------&#62; http://amzn.to/1r7KMGa<br /><br />You won't regret getting that setup, but if you don't get it, at least I could warn you about this one after my experience!"
672,__label1__,I keep dropping my phone since I put this case on. Somehow it made my phone more slippery and difficult to handle than before. Returned.
673,__label1__,"Easy to clean, removes dust efficiently and above all, it's flexible. I just wish it had longer handle for hard to reach areas."
674,__label1__,"I purchased bushnell powerview 8x21 compact binocular for my wildlife viewing and are great,bi never strained to view the animals and this made my trip enjoyable.They have a good viewing power."
675,__label1__,"I was so happy to find this wonderful toolkit, with such many positive comments<br /><br />BUT to my dissapointed. it can't open my watch because the range of the opener is too small!<br /><br />My watch is fossil AM 4102, compare regular watch it looks little bit bigger,but the adjustable opener can't fit this size!"
676,__label1__,"Sharp, mixed sizes, great scissors. I don't think the paper cutter utensil is worth much - hard to get the cut started, but I will keep using it and see if I change my mind"
677,__label1__,"When the purple nail polish is wet, it looks really cool, but when it dries it turns almost black and it's not very glittery. i like the plain glitter and i think it would look good with a white basecoat."
678,__label1__,"This curtain is NOT something I would hang in a bright trendy or formal space. My boys bedroom has a blanket which matches the blue in this and his room is a smidgen dark so you can't tell quality etc. It is a simple curtain, blocks light, although you can see pinholes in the daylight so not true blackout. It does seem to reduce road noise. We live on a Parkway. So it works but nothing fabulous looking but not ugly."
679,__label1__,David platt is a bit of a phenomenon in my mind. His books are blockbusters for the christian faith and worth while for any serious believer. I definately recommend this book!
680,__label1__,These have a very brilliant color and they are stackable! They stack with about 2 in clearance. Went through top rack dishwasher with no problems and the rims are very smooth to drink from.
681,__label1__,These bowels are wonderful. They are very versatile in there use. The lids that come with each bowel makes it great when you are storing something.
682,__label1__,"The only thing I don't like about it is there are some triangular slots on the side of the can that catch the trash sack when I am taking the sack out. If I take care to pull these back out of the way, it works great."
683,__label1__,"Great product, if you're looking for a stand i highly recommend this one, cheap cheap cheap, very sturdy, the fan works great and isn't too loud (obviously you will hear it to SOME extent) and the controller charging docks charge well and you can just drop the controller right on for quick connections in those crazy firefights you KNOW your controller always dies during"
684,__label1__,"Everything is above expectation. A bit smaller than I thought it would be. Has some glitches. Surprisingly even with a quad-core it lags a bit. Has no support in xfa for mods or to root. Recommended for people who are happy with simpler phones. It looks like There is no auto bright and screen is brilliant , wish it had amoled."
685,__label1__,"Quality not that good. Don't expect too much from this product, it is cheap for a reason. With that said, as long as you don't fill it up more than half way and with items that are very hard to chop, it works great."
686,__label1__,What should I say about these needles? They are great for sewing. I also like that it's assorted. I have many needles to choose from. Even my granddaughter could use it if they have project in school for sewing.
687,__label1__,"I had to buy a new mug for my daughter, after I ruined hers. She absolutely loves Doctor Who and this mug. I bought mine too. It worked out great for me because now I have my own too. Great buy for any Doctor Who fan! We're both mesmerized by the images disappearing and reappearing. It is officially his favorite mug for hot chocolate!"
688,__label1__,The clip on the book light did not clip strongly. The button to turn the light on and off did not work smoothly. The light was dim and blue colored. The light bulb did not work long. I do not see a way to change batteries.
689,__label1__,"These shorts fit like a sack. While they made me sweat when I worked out, I spent far too much time trying to keep them pulled up. I would not waste my money on this product. These rate &#34;zero&#34; stars. ??"
690,__label1__,"I haven't lost much weight yet but I don't feel hungry like I normally do and don't feel like snacking much, hope my weight will start dropping soon."
691,__label1__,"I initially bought this product from third party seller in CA. They shipped me knock off, on contacting amzer support they told me how some companies are running a scam and selling knock off products and they were very nice to ship me a Free replacement product. This time the product I received was amzer and I could feel the difference, this product was very good and is working very well with my iphone 5. Highly recommended but make sure it is the real deal."
692,__label1__,"I purchased this hat for my father. He has some skin cancer issues and should be wearing a hat at all times when outdoors. The hat is very nice quality, fit perfectly and looks great on him! I was very pleased with my purchase."
693,__label1__,I was looking for a hat that is not too big but will keep the sun rays away from my eyes. I would use this for every jogging or walk. I just hope it will last longer.
694,__label1__,"I use this tea tree oil for household disinfecting purposes. I would definitely not recommend this for any personal care uses as the different smell leaves me feeling suspect as to whether it is therapeutic grade or not. Overall, I'd recommend it for someone to consider for themselves due to the price, but only with the above comments."
695,__label1__,"Works as described. The ergonomic handle is a big improvement over the traditional models. The blades are sharp, making it unsuitable for children helping around the kitchen."
696,__label1__,Bad experience all the way around. Didn't get the items at the same time.. And once received they didn't hold a charge as good as it should have. The picture was of a black battery when in fact I was sent a white battery. Worst experience ever...
697,__label1__,Perfect that you can listen to music on this Bluetooth but what's the point if the sounds quality is very low. There is no volume adjustment when listening to the person on the other end. I didn't return it because of the shipping and handling cost. I kept it as a standby Bluetooth in my car.
698,__label1__,The buttons on this thing is woo hard to press. Especially I use the power button a lot and it bothers me to have a hard to press button. There is no tactile feeling on volume buttons either. I keep looking at screen to see if it worked.
699,__label1__,"First let me say that I'm a big Sony fan, but this video camera is very disappointing. It made the video quality of my 8mm look like HD. The footage was only good in the outdoors or brightly lit rooms. It's good for low resolution internet uploads"
700,__label1__,"I put this beautiful crystal spark plug niceEshop at a very reasonable price, but I like how it looks, so all my mobile phone accessories look great! Worth the money looks more expensive than happy,"
701,__label1__,The bed was really easy to assemble and it looked great. MY husband and I have been using it for over a month and it's still holding up pretty well. I like the style of the bed and it fits our mattress perfectly.
702,__label1__,"This shampoo smells really bad that I can't bear to use it any longer.<br />After trying it just 3 days, I had to give it up because of the foul smell. It smells like gasoline almost.<br /><br />I can't comment on the results because I haven't use it long enough to know."
703,__label1__,"This product doesn't have me entirely convinced yet. But with that being said, my weight has always fluctuated quite a bit so it's hard to tell whether Garcinia really is as life changing for me as many other users are reporting. Maybe it's my metabolism or my eating habits (I usually skip breakfast and lunch, but go by on coffee until a light meal around 3pm and then eat a bigger meal in the evening). I started taking the Garcinia with my main evening meal but so far I can't tell whether it has really helped me. I will give it another month and then maybe switch to green coffee bean extract."
704,__label1__,What is funny about this book that its not to off on what happens behind closed doors when the president campaign comes around every 4 years. Nevertheless I liked the book for what its worth it has some strong points.
705,__label1__,"When I purchased this headset, I had been looking for a quality pair for a long time. I had tried time and time again hoping for something that sounded great and was comfortable on my head.<br /><br />Not only was this headset extremely uncomfortable, but the sound quality was horrible. After only a week, one side stopped working and I had to hit it to try to get it to work again. This was absolutely NOT what I expected after looking at the other good reviews.<br /><br />I searched again, asked around and finally found a headset that works now, and I love it! It has been about 2 months and it still works great. I can go hours at a time without them bugging me and the sound quality is AMAZING!<br /><br />If you need a QUALITY headset, go here ------&#62; http://amzn.to/1nsrbPn<br /><br />I promise, they are well worth what they cost. You cannot beat quality!!!"
706,__label1__,I bought as gift for my son. He says he loves his new headphones. The quality is very good. His only complaint is that they are a little bit of an awkward fit. I offered to send them back but he said absolutely not. Thinking of getting myself a pair.
707,__label1__,"Predictably enough, my nieces and nephews tried to get into my liquor cabinet the last time they came over. So now, I have these locks to keep them out, hopefully anyway. I don't relish the thought of them getting drunk on vintages they don't understand, after all."
708,__label1__,My hubby has had his pair of reef sandals for years. They are extremely durable and very comfortable. I will definitely be buying him another pair when the current ones finally are done.
709,__label1__,"Interesting movie about military school, and one that does not portray its characters as cardboard cutouts (as happens so often with movies about teens) but as real people with depth.  It does get off at a slow start but has a well crafted plot, and one does not stretch credulity; in other words not everything turns out as the audience wants it to."
710,__label1__,These are nice curtains that fit a standard size window. We bought this for our 3 year old daughter's room to match the rest of the bedroom line she has and they are great! Have had them for 9 months now and still holding up strong.
711,__label1__,"I bought Motorola H730 Blue tooth Headset a month a go. I am very happy with the head set. I was able to link my personal phone and my work phone to the head set without difficulty. Easy to use, has voice prompts you can turn off or on. Sound is clear on both ends."
712,__label1__,"i got this for my 12 year old son who cant put his guitar down, he likes it because of its durability and color options plus its a cheap buy for me so good deal."
713,__label1__,This stuff here was no good in my personal opinion. I didn't lose any weight at all and It certainly did not curb my appetite. I tried a different brand and had much better results though so I don't know what to make of that but that is what it is.
714,__label1__,"My sister liked this ring and I can see why, she has small slender fingers, unlike mine, so I wouldn't recommend this to any one who has fingers that are a bit bigger not slender and knowing that you wouldn't wear it on a daily basis. I'd spend money on something else that's worth wearing all the time!"
715,__label1__,this one really uncomfortable to wear.The size and quality of the cotton isn't very good.I accidentally order second time and trashed the whole pack.
716,__label1__,I was so excited when i came across this apple peeler. I was so tired of using my carrot peeler for my apples.<br /><br />I only gave this review 3 stars because the quality just isn't there. After the first use the spring broke on the peeler ring. I am still able to use the product it just doesn't spring back to take off the whole peel.<br /><br />I also wish the silver counter hook was mounted on the other side of the peeler. It does not hook to the counter the way it was designed.<br /><br />It was very east to install the handle just need a phillips head screw driver.
717,__label1__,This chrome aluminum case was a great bargain. I looked at other metallic cases that were quite expensive. The case looks fantastic with a white iPhone 4s and it looks expensive. I have not dropped my phone yet but I believe the case would protect the phone well if dropped from a few feet. I'll update it later.
718,__label1__,If you like the aroma of the coconut oil then you will definitely like this product. Personally I like the aroma of the coconut oil but my body doesn't seem to be able to deal with it well. Therefore I have stopped buying it anymore.
719,__label1__,This bag has a lot of space! I can also put feeding bottles and some clothes on it. I love it so much!  The design looks like it's not a diaper bag. It was very well-made.
720,__label1__,When we needed to print the apple located the Epson workforce 445. I learned to scan to the apple after we put the Epson disc in. It was a fast process. slow scanning but that is the Epson. It cost more but it is living up to our expectation. The apple was the best price anywhere. It arrived on time and packaged well. It is a new experience but easy to learn. Phone help is $100. We read the book and understand the computer without help.
721,__label1__,"It is really a quality bag and the price was really great. Works ok but wish it was a little larger, wish it had zipper instead of snap for accessories compartment, wish pocket on back had Velcro to close."
722,__label1__,"Much smaller than expected. The description really should indicate that this is a mini donut pan. I'm disappointed, but the pan is decent quality for what it is. Also, I did not receive any recipes as mentioned in the description."
723,__label1__,"Last year I bought a set & they do keep veggies & fruits fresh for a long time & I do save money. I bought this new set b/c the rectangular containers were presented to hold more but they don't so I returned them. The Presenter seldom closes a lid & that's b/c you can't fit much in them especially large Bell Peppers, lettuce, a normal bag of spinach etc. It's only my husband & I so it's not like I'm trying to store food for an army."
724,__label1__,The case is too thin and snapped into two pieces on the very first time I tried to take it off to clean my phone. The dirt gets trapped inside the case and need to clean very often.
725,__label1__,"When I turn the volume more than half way up on these speakers, there is significant distortion. There is no way to get decent volume without distortion."
726,__label1__,I don't know if it is all the hype but I didn't see any differences in my skin tones or any improvement in my complexion as it claims.<br />That is two product that I got fooled into buying and didn't work
727,__label1__,"I am a male reviewer. This is my second Brother sewing machine. I had to get a new one because I was sewing heavy material and the Key popped out of the needle assembly and I lost the key and I was unable to find a replacement, so it was easier to buy a new machine."
728,__label1__,"My sister had one of these when we went over for a visit and I told her to throw it away after seeing how ineffective it is. Remember that everything counts when your baby's wellbeing is on the line. Hospitals usually provide nasal aspirators that work quite well, so just use those."
729,__label1__,"Such a Russian classic. My second favorite book by a Russian author next to Crime and Punishment. The story, the characters, descriptions of the events, the clothing of that period is incredible."
730,__label1__,"I bought these kitchen scissors because I saw it was voted Best Kitchen Scissors. I have children so it was great that it had a safety lock feature on it. They designed for comfort, which I can agree to that after having tried it. I am left handed and it fit well. I can use it for practically anything, which holds true to the meaning of multipurpose. However, I tried to wash it using the dishwasher and that did not turn out so well. I will have to handwash it, as recommended in the description. So please be aware of this. That is really my only complaint about the scissors and my reasoning for the three star."
731,__label1__,"The printer works great, I really needed it for the scanner and it's great for that. It prints great too, my only complaint about the printing though is that it takes FOREVER to boot up before it actually prints."
732,__label1__,garcinia don't work. stupid decision but i fell for it. all the reviews that say this is good are bought and paid for
733,__label1__,It's not the best rope but it works ok for the price. It will work if you need something quick but I wouldnt use it for anything heavy duty.
734,__label1__,I was mislead and extremely disappointed. This product did not support its claims and I question the legitimacy of this product. .. Seems to be a very profitable scam!
735,__label1__,"Not too glittery and not too nimble. A stunning wrist watch from the top rated genre of Casio edifice. Bought it from them because their professionalism is undoubtedly top notch. Coming to the watch, be prepared friends."
736,__label1__,"Just started using this, so far I like it, it's light weight and gives that fresh feeling to your skin."
737,__label1__,"This is not a good potty for little boys!! The splash guard is almost non-existent and the opening for the potty is very small. My son is at the top of the growth chart for his height and weight. In order to get any use from the almost non-existent splash guard, he has to sit too far back on the potty and because the opening of the potty is very small, his bottom is part way off the potty."
738,__label1__,GIAC Certified Intrusion Analyst Certification (GCIA) won't help you pass..but may ensure you fail.<br /><br />How so?  Over 50% of the info in this book is not current.<br /><br />So you will study and prep for the wrong questions.
739,__label1__,This set is really cute and includes a ton of different items. It is made well and I'm really happy with it. Each piece is well-made and has a lot of detail.<br /><br />Provided for free to review by manufacturer.
740,__label1__,"Followed instructions as provided with a healthy diet and exercise. Did not see anything different in weight, appetite or anything."
741,__label1__,I love being able to go in and shower without being cold. It takes some time to get warm enough in that room before I can shower. I am not sure how long I would need to leave the fan on to absorb the water on the shower walls because I was use to wiping it down and I am still doing that.
742,__label1__,"I was looking for more than the typical glass set and I found what I was looking for. They are heavy, which I like, so I can use them everyday and not have to worry about chipping them. Friends and family love them! My only wish is that they were a little taller and could hold just a little more."
743,__label1__,"This is okay for chilling a glass or two of wine, but don't expect it to chill your whole bottle.  Good for in a pinch though."
744,__label1__,The muffins I made came out great. I only sprayed the pan since I didn't have the cups to fit a large pan. It washed up nice. The pan is thick but not heavy. I would recommend this pan.
745,__label1__,It mixes up easily. The texture of the pancakes is perfect. The pumpkin flavor is not too over powering and just the right touch of spices. I highly recommend this item to pancake lovers and pumpkin flavor fans.
746,__label1__,"I often would have liked to have on my previous KVM. Also, while you can't tell from the photo (where it looks short), the wire / cable from the main box to that toggle is pretty long (about 6 feet). Yet another little pleasant surprise: the button has a rubberized bottom so it doesn't slide around easily on the desktop."
747,__label1__,"Fits good on my 58mm lens. Although it can be a bit loose sometimes but for the most part it stays one. If you are looking for an affordable lens hood this is a good buy, otherwise spend the money on something nicer and made by canon."
748,__label1__,"The compartments are plenty.It's really nice, The material is good and the wallet is made well. The compartments are plenty. I love my Blue synthetic leather wallet. It doesn't look cheap."
749,__label1__,"We were looking for a great non-stick pan that would last a long time and we thought that this was it. As many reviewers already pointed out though, it loses its effectiveness<br />eventually. Ours lasted almost 7 months, but still."
750,__label1__,"Lightweight, comfortable, surprising bass, good range. Can't comment on water resistance or how long they'll hold up. Looks like batteries may be replaceable if need be. Can't argue with the price."
751,__label1__,"I ordered &#34;BLACK&#34; & they sent &#34;BRIGHT WHITE&#34;! Must be Color Blind FOOLS! DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!! You will NOT get what you ordered right! I didn't unpackage it, I put my purchase on EBAY & trying to get my money back!"
752,__label1__,Loved this product. It was easy to apply and looks great on the wall! I would recommend this product to my family and friends.
753,__label1__,"I use this gadget in the kitchen, but also for decoration. If you love to have fun - this is the right one for you, but it's also a great gift. Just hanging in the kitchen, this is a fun product to have."
754,__label1__,"This microwave came with plastic shrink wrapped over it. Sort of a thick shrink wrap which you have to remove. It's hard to tell it's there and it's a chore to get off. In fact, it appears they shrink wrapped the parts before they put it together, because the plastic stuff is in the seems where the oven is put together and that you can't get out. I never would have noticed it was there, but it covers the vents.<br /><br />Okay, once the thick plastic wrap is off, how does the microwave perform? As good as any other and it's attractive, but it's small, the interior I mean. I expected larger. The pizza oven could be bigger. The large frozen pizzas we get at Safeway are too big for it. Still, cut them in half and it performs okay. It's perfect for the ones we get at Costco. All in all, this microwave does the job, but I don't think I'd recommend it for someone who cooks a lot, because of it's size. But for a bachelor or bachelorette, it'd be perfect."
755,__label1__,"Great to have in your house it does the job no its not electric and count if for you, you can't be so lazy about counting and you have to work a bit. small tip its usually much easier to count your own money, you may not see it as a problem. If you do count your coins properly you will see the benefits."
756,__label1__,"We use three of these file organizers for my busy psychiatric practice on a daily basis for charts of patients to be seen each day. They are invaluable to me. The chart labels are clearly seen, allowing me at a glance to see what my day looks like and how many more patients there are to be seen. They are inexpensive and rock-solid with charts in them. I can't think of a better system for organizing charts to be used that day!"
757,__label1__,When I saw the ad for this movie I was intrigued and then I ran into this book in the book store. Taught by my previous experience that tells me that books are far more better than the movies I read this and it proved out to be true once again. You get so much more from the book.
758,__label1__,Putting together was hard enough with two ppl. But to finish and realize that drawers metal was installed not straight and the drawers don't go in evenly was very disappointing
759,__label1__,"These headphones are awesome.Really light as a feather and a durable cable.Sound quality is great as well but only thing that i had problems with was the rubber head of the headset,which has trouble fitting my ear but i hope I will fix it in no time!"
760,__label1__,"After trying this supplement,  I do not feel that it lives up to the hype.  We used the whole bottle but never felt right after using it"
761,__label1__,"This is a pretty thin replacement that really makes me nervous to use. It's definitely much better to just get a new one, even one that's much cheaper than what you had before."
762,__label1__,"Purchased this watch to give to my son. Looks nice but hope the clasp on the band holds up, it does not look that sturdy. Other wise this product is a great value towards an inexpensive gift for a loved one."
763,__label1__,Is it possible that the author meant to write  a CAPM book but by mistake marketed it as a PMP book?  Extremely misleading and full or errors. Questions are awful and have no similarity with real life questions. It is an ok book for the CAPM preparation though.
764,__label1__,"This mouthpiece worked fine, yet the cover would continuously slide off, often resulting in dust getting into the mouthpiece. I would recommend this to people, as long as they are willing to clean the mouthpiece thoroughly before and after use to prevent dust from accumulating."
765,__label1__,"I wanted to like this product but just couldn't force myself to. Was so excited to buy it as it's cheaper than some of the well known brands, however it just doesn't cut it. Carrots came out only in short slices and zucchinis became mangled stuck together, and I just couldn't get it to work like advertized. The blades look dull, and the Vegetti appears to be made from very cheap plastic; I don't know how long before this thing breaks. I guess you get what you pay for, but with what I know now I wouldn't even spend $10 on it."
766,__label1__,"great earrings, i just love it especially when it matches my dress and the design is almost same with my shoes, i mean this earring really fits me in my all black seductive new dress..."
767,__label1__,"I did my research I decided on this machine, I was so excited to get it! Since it is expensive, I wanted to save some money any where I could so I decided to get a refurbished one."
768,__label1__,the phone case fit the iphone 5c what i bought it for but its a black case with a sticker on it and it looks nothing like the phone case in the photo
769,__label1__,"this is a great frying pan and super easy to clean.but, after using it a few times, i observed several small patches of lost coating by the edge/lip of the pan. overall this is ok, but not really excellent."
770,__label1__,Great price to renew my Xbox subscription. Even better was the option to receive my mail in rebate within a week if I choose to. I will look to you guys again for my next renewal as well. Thanks
771,__label1__,"I got this toy for my nephew for his birthday. I needed a toy that wasn't going to break and something to inspire him to do better in life. I got the bang for my buck when I bought this. The first thing he did when he got this toy was drop it. But, it still functioned like it was brand new. Overall, it a great plane and my nephew wants to be an inventor now more than ever."
772,__label1__,Work fine and perfectly serviceable for the low price. Don't expect quality in the sound for music or vids though.
773,__label1__,This rice cooker is the first one I've owned to make perfect brown rice. The last two have overcooked it every time. Also works great for steel cut oatmeal. I'm very happy with this cooker!
774,__label1__,Brought this wallet for my husband he loves it. It holds a good amount of cards and folds flat so he is able to carry it in his back pocket or suit pockets discreetly. The color is rich and looks very expensive. Plan to buy one for my father.
775,__label1__,"Thank goodness I got this from the library instead of shelling out money for it. Unbelievable how backwards the views are. The ""style"" of training is nothing short of animal abuse and was already outdated twenty years ago. There are dozens and dozens of books on positive reinforcement training and babies/kids that leave this book in the dust."
776,__label1__,I don't smoke or anything so I am unsure why my case is now a yellow color. Extremely disappointing.
777,__label1__,"THIS IS VERY UNSAFE TO USE DO NOT BUY!!  this item no matter how many times I washed it is greasy the mafucature supposedly makes it with grease so it should stay nice and shiny however its not at all safe being your feet keep sliding across the mats, I tried washing it with hot water and soap multiple times and that did not help my cousin who bought this together with me has the same issue,<br />Ps they are very cheaply made!!"
778,__label1__,i don't plan on taking so many in a 6 months span lol... you need to check if the expiration is in order otherwise you;ll end up like me with another bottle of medicine tossed with the trash.
779,__label1__,The quality of the frames is very good. I love these frames and I wish I could find them in other colors.
780,__label1__,These are extremely weak. I have tried a couple turmerics but none of them work good. I dunno if I am going to try a third one.
781,__label1__,This little TV is affordable and we use in it our kitchen for recipes. But the software is sucky. It is certainly not something you would find on an Apple operating system and even makes Windows 8 look good. But I did not buy it for that. I bought it to watch mindless television in the kitchen. Like Marta and cooking shows.
782,__label1__,"I thought it was sturdy but sadly it is so flimsy, When all my shoes fell, then the essence of this organizer is gone.<br />Practically speaking , better buy those somewhat expensive but sturdy ones. This can't hold and organize bunch of your shoes."
783,__label1__,Don't waste your money. Took as directed for over two months. Increased dosage as says to try on box. Nothing. Might as well just drink more coffee early in the day if you ask me. WAY cheaper than this over hyped crap.
784,__label1__,"I really don't need food or water. You know why. I'm coming to your house to take it. The only part of the book I focused on was the weapons but guess what. There was very little on weapons and more on all the other stuff. People, gangs and other groups will be your worst nightmare. I suggest you find out real quick who you can and cant trust because I'll come looking fro you. Sorry, well come looking for you."
785,__label1__,I really wanted to just fall in love with this butter but I found that I had to keep reapplying which is a turnoff for me. Seems like a nice lady too. Returned.
786,__label1__,the headband is actually not as wide as in the picture and not really the same color it came as kind of a sparkle gold and its uncomfortable itchy and pretty tight
787,__label1__,"Excellent product! I just wish that the bottom was easier to put on and take off, and I wish the inside was lined with a rubber material (like some cases that I have purchased in the past). I am scared that if I drop my phone in this case, it will crack since the case is plastic and not lined on the inside with rubber. All in all, this case is wonderful!"
788,__label1__,"This painting is my serenity. Perfect for the bedroom and relaxation time. I prefer to have it somewhere I can look at it while I turn on my mini water fountain, as I listen to the sounds of the water and looking at this painting takes me to a place of complete peace. After a long stressful day at work, or as part as my meditation, this never fails me. It takes me to a dreamland while I am still awake. Having the extra added mini waterfall really brings out this artwork to an even larger scale of reality. If you enjoy peace, and clearing your thoughts, dim the lights and just let yourself go, and you will soon find yourself to be in that place of deep relaxation."
789,__label1__,This is a pretty lame product to be honest. It's just too hard to use and I'm confused as to what it's actually meant to be.
790,__label1__,"While in the beginning all seemed ok, but started to have problems opening the program. When the program did open, I was able to do everything the program was supposed to do, it was just that I could not open it within an hour or two and sometimes not before the next day."
791,__label1__,"Dont waste your money on this, I might as well have gone to the dollar store to buy the same thing because it is not silent and my dog has no reaction to this at all.<br />Please dont leave in the same time, you can leave 1 today and 1 tomorrow"
792,__label1__,Bought this for my newborn and very pleased with it! The size is just perfect for home or takes along too! Colors and design are really nice! She loves to snuggle in it and really enjoys looking at it! She's delighted when she sees it I guess from the circular designs & colors! Now my baby girl is eight months and inseparable!
793,__label1__,"I like It very much!  it's very nice!  This jacket is very well made, fits well, and is great for layering!"
794,__label1__,".I was quite impressed with this multi-function face mask since it was so stretchable and it would constantly stay in place and I had no discomforts at all of wearing this certain product.<br /><br />It is useful, helpful and functional and I had been using this for long period of time and it is still great like a new purchase. It has very good quality materials."
795,__label1__,"I got two thumbs up for this key chain. I could put a lot of keys such as car keys, home keys, and so on. I hope it would have another color like gold. But the rest is fine. It's perfect for my keys."
796,__label1__,"The battery pack works well. At first I was concerned because the amperage was a different number, but that doesn't seem to have any effect on the performance. The charge lasts a long time and our camera works fine."
797,__label1__,"Time doesn't move by any slower as you get older and we seem to stop using our brain as much as we get older, things turn into habits and not thoughts. This is a dangerous occurrence for the older folks because it can lead to some serious problems, keep your mind fresh and active with this quick guide to helping you sharpen your thinking skills."
798,__label1__,The optics clarity was not. Ever close to what I expected from them. The optics is closer to what I would expect from fisher price. Bottom line they are over priced for what you get.
799,__label1__,"Moving forward with my recent healthy lifestyle I decided I wanted to monitor my weight. After looking through reviews I decided this was the one I wanted. Although, I found out it is not what I was looking for.<br /><br />First off, I tested the scale by placing a specified weight on it and each time it would miss the actual weight by 2-4 pounds being either higher or lower...<br /><br />This was pretty frustrating because sometimes even the smallest drop in weight makes me happy and keeps me motivated. I wanted something that would be accurate every time I stepped on it. I dealt with this for a little while before doing serious research and getting a scale that I LOVE.<br /><br />I have owned it for over a month now and can say it is accurate every single time! I check it every so often with a weight to be sure and it has never been wrong.<br /><br />I actually ordered it here on Amazon ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1lKSlNc<br /><br />This thing is magnificent! I hope I could help others by sharing my experience."
800,__label1__,"I gave these goggles as a gift to my brother's kids. They are participating in the swimming team and they spend a lot of time training every day so I thought that this will be a great gift for them. They were very happy and after using them at the training sessions, they told me that these are the best goggles they ever got. They said that the goggles are perfect and the straps adjustment is very easy. They liked the blue color very much because it is their favorite color. As they are using them for some time now, they didn't broke and the quality didn't change. I liked the one year quality guarantee, it is a great offer but I didn't use it till now. The visibility is very good for outdoor usage while it is not as good when used indoor, and this is why I gave it 4 stars. Over all, they are well made where they protect the eyes perfectly. I highly recommend this great product. Thumbs Up"
801,__label1__,"This speaker was supposed to just let us play some tunes while enjoying a day of fishing, but it performs even better than what I thought. The volume goes so high, people by the shore could hear it and they were probably 2 km away!"
802,__label1__,I was hopin for more mileage from the curcumin pills. I dont have arthritis bt I do have headache problems and I read it was good for that. I took it twice when I had a headache but it did not make it go away.
803,__label1__,I use these types of wallets all the time. I like to put a credit card or two in the pockets along with a license. The wallets I have had in the past allowed many more cards than that but this one would not accept even one.
804,__label1__,Just get this product already. It works as advertised and won't disappoint unless you're expecting it to do something that it wasn't even designed to do.
805,__label1__,"I purchased this webcam to keep in touch with family but it never worked. I followed the instructions in the handbook, which there weren't many of to start with. The cam never got a picture, never recorded. I followed the trouble shooting suggestions and they didn't work."
806,__label1__,"Very handy to have this kind of toolbox inside your house. Saves me time for running to our garage just to get a screwdriver. Well, you really can't risk your tools laying around with no container. Pretty decent for its price. I had to replace some tools with mine but nothing serious."
807,__label1__,"You don't need to put it around your wrist or any body part. You can put it anywhere; love this band, works great on my 2 1/2 year old grandson."
808,__label1__,This was ordered to be in my entrance under my mirror but it was too tall and it was not the way I imagine it. It is doing it function for the shoes but it is cheap looking.
809,__label1__,"I like this but it's not perfect.  Works best on flat surfaces, if you have a curved surface it's not going to be as effective there."
810,__label1__,"Really great athletic tape. I'm constantly getting my ankles taped to play basketball, need to immobilize my ankles. It definitely beats the nasty white most athletes use that leaves a mess after you take it off. Since it's called Fidowrap, I'm guessing it's for dogs? It didn't really make a difference for me, but I did use the white tape to mummify my dog for halloween. Worked great, didn't come off."
811,__label1__,"This scissor works for everything I tried it on. It cuts paper, it cuts cardboard, it even cuts through Styrofoam, and I always have trouble with that! All things considered, this is a very good product."
812,__label1__,The name is bit misleading as it's not made in Chicago or for that matter the US. it's made in China and the handles are quite flimsy. That said if you are not into serious cooking the set will do quite nicely. If a friend is looking for a cheap set for not heavy duty cooking I will recommend this product. Otherwise look some more.
813,__label1__,My dog still has fleas even after using this for over a month. I'm not sure how &#34;fast&#34; fast acting is supposed to be but I'm quite certain that its quicker than a month. Had to go to the vet because the situation got too bad :(
814,__label1__,"I was hesitant to buy a drumset without seeing it first, after my son broke his first set. I was pleasantly surprised with the workmanship of the product when it arrived. However the assembly instructions, left something to be desired. I ended up putting the bass thing together multiple times: first i had used the wrong tension rods and didnt know until i got to assembling 1 of the Toms, then I had leftover washers and realized they should have been placed on those tension rods. I still have a few pieces that I'm not sure where they go."
815,__label1__,The case looks gorgeous on my phone but after a couple of hours I noticed the back is really scratched up.
816,__label1__,easier to hold and use... changed home phone to cell and use this all the time...much easier and clearer ..
817,__label1__,I purchased this to replace a different cordless trimmer. You get all the attachments from 1/8&#34; inch to 1&#34; plus attachments for over the ear and an eyebrow trimmer. You also get two additional trimmers (one for fine hair in hard to reach places with the bulkier clipper and a medium size clipper I use for the neck and around the ears).
818,__label1__,"My cats all really love this cat food. I'm not sure why but they will only eat these flavors and they hate the seafood flavors. I guess they prefer to eat land dwelling animals, I don't know. Anyway, this is the only kind I buy for them. It is consistent and always arrives as expected."
819,__label1__,These have melotonin or something similar in them and what I didn't know was that for some people melotonin causes extreme insomnia and drowsiness.

821,__label1__,"This tea kettle looks nice on the outside and I thought I had found a really nice kettle for daily use. Unfortunately, after some time, the inside became a little rusty and the rust has increased with use."
822,__label1__,"This new umbrella provides shade for a very large area. I'm having a bit of a problem finding concrete slabs to fit under the edge, so I used 4 square concrete stepping stones to hold it down. The umbrella itself moves too much during a strong breeze but other than that it's really nice."
823,__label1__,"They are big enough to hold up for a whole set, then I change them for the next set. They aren't so big as some others that cost more, but then the bigger ones at times seem to make me hotter, so I sweat more.."
824,__label1__,This was the first wallet that I valued so far. It has plenty of room for the cards and important receipts inside. It also serves as a dual purpose because there's a room for phone and for make up. I would definitely buy this again.
825,__label1__,I have never tried S&W baked beans before and after these are gone I doubt I'll ever try them again. The beans are small and the sauce is watery and anemic-tasting. Really bland. Very disappointing product.
826,__label1__,"Not bad if you aren't doing much in the way of gaming or something, if so look for a faster card.  But this one does the job depending on your needs."
827,__label1__,"The watch looks good, with a nice mix on the band. And the feature allows me to see the time in low light. My last watch was a from other brand and lasted for years, so I'm hopeful that this one will, as well. I really like it and recommend it--a good-looking watch for a good price!"
828,__label1__,I used this product many years ago and it was the best. I was so glad to find it on your web site. It makes garlic bread that is absolutely delicious. Better price than regular grocery stores. Love it!!!
829,__label1__,Love it! great fit for my phone and it is so comfy to handle<br />It doesn't seem to slide down<br />Great Product!
830,__label1__,My coach found this and recommended we all learn...it really did help me improve and my technique has gotten much better!  Here is the link     [...]
831,__label1__,The ink is very clear and prints great. The only problem I have with HP cartridges is that they run out so fast and you have to keep replacing the entire cartridge. A decently refillable design would be much better so you buy the ink tubes only and not the entire printing device.
832,__label1__,"this is poor quality, the led won't last long, the LED is chip in the cover. no instruction! no wire to connect the switch, how?"
833,__label1__,glad I decided to look online. Options available in stores were to limited. easy to install once decided how to configure.
834,__label1__,"The watch arrived in great condition, packed very well, directions or the watch was very easy to read. I have had many people ask what store I got it from, when I told them here. They seemed surprised."
835,__label1__,I have not got to use this memory card as there was a problem with the camera I ordered. So I have not been able to see how it works as of yet. I am sure it will work fine.
836,__label1__,"Hehe. I have to admit that I loved this book. It was poor writing quality, as everybody says. Basically junk food in book form. But it was great! I couldn't put it down and frankly some of the scenes turned me on."
837,__label1__,"It is really fancy looking and well-functioning light fans. Fans are working great and it has  levels of strengths. But, the light is pretty dim and yellowish. If you prefer a bright light, this might not be a good choice."
838,__label1__,"It didn't say it was made in China, but apparently it was. That doesn't really bother me. What bothers me is that I spent money on something that doesn't actually work the way the advertisement said it would. It was a huge struggle to huge and I don't have any intention of recommending this to anyone. Or using it again, for that matter."
839,__label1__,I bought this for my parents anniversary gift and we just set it up this past weekend. I was shocked at how easy it was to set up and how sturdy it is. They loved the color of it too.
840,__label1__,"At the very least, I learned something from this book, even if it isn't the most excellent resource."
841,__label1__,This not a good product. Because it make by simple chemical. This is not a good product. It is really bad.
842,__label1__,"Perfect for simple windows during the summer or spring. Yes, they;re quite simple and all, there're also some defects on the actual product but I managed to fix them and now they look great on my windows."
843,__label1__,"This broked after 2 days after i bought it!Not really good but it works really well when i worked,I think mine is just a defective item."
844,__label1__,I've had mixed results with this one.  Doesn't always seem to mix things well.  Also could wish for a lower speed setting.  But for a basic mixer I guess it's not too bad.  Have had better luck using it off the stand.
845,__label1__,this would be a cute birthday present for my niece.. i want her to feel like queen elsa with this cute scepter :)
846,__label1__,"FINALLY, found an iron that meets my needs and so far exceeded my expectations. This is probably the 5th iron I've purchased and by far the BEST!"
847,__label1__,"I'm very disappointed with this set, did not even met my standard expectations. This is such a waste"
848,__label1__,"I have been drinking lipton iced tea for what seems like forever. If you drink a lot of tea, then the packaging is perfect for you. Everyone in my family drink iced tea so it is nice to be able to quickly have a cup hot or cold, both are delicous. I would also recommend this iced tea mix, [[ASIN:B009PIEW3O 100% Pure Instant Iced Tea Powder (Unsweetened) 8 oz. - Buy One Get One Free!]]. It comes in a resealable foil bag so whether you want to make a bunch or just a cup its quick and easy to do. Plus it is literally the only tea I've tasted that actually rivals lipton without even adding any sweetener to it, really really good."
849,__label1__,"I was hoping to keep the temp of my unit on the low end long enough to actually get anything done with it, and it does its job. The problem though is that the noise it makes is extremely distracting. It's like playing close to a huge room fan.To be fair though, I have to emphasize that it does keep the heat away for long period of time."
850,__label1__,"was disappointed in this bag, feel like i could get something similar at the local store for less money, size was good , got the coral and gray , did not like the coral to harsh looking , the gray was okay, but decided that not worth keeping for the price so sent back."
851,__label1__,Great light for my wife's Bernina sewing machine. Sturdy and durable and easily attached. Long bendable neck allows much flexibility for positioning light where needed. Good LED lumination without the heat output.
852,__label1__,"It does looks identical to an Apple made charger but after few weeks, the charge signal started coming on/off on my iphone and suddenly stopped charging iPhone.It consistently works to sync my devices, but if you are looking for something to also charge your devices regularly, take a pass on this product! But at least I got this for a cheap price."
853,__label1__,"I ordered an iPhone 5 case. But you spent the earphones. At first I did not know what this is. I was soon know. It's that pink I ordered a pink case, but you had a pink earphones. Imitation iPhone Earphones"
854,__label1__,"not that great, although the brush works and all but the hair on it easily breaks and it gets really difficult when trying to make fine art nail. At first it was awesome, but then after a while, as i said it breaks off."
855,__label1__,"Have had one of these for about a month now.  Haven't seen any jams in that time, used on a daily basis.  Maybe some batches had a problem?"
856,__label1__,For Diminishing fine Lines & Wrinkles guaranty i search and brought this product. But my line and wrinkles are as it was before. Now i am at deep thought. What is this product??
857,__label1__,"Grape Nuts are good for you; at least as far as a processed cereal can be good for you, but regular Grape Nuts don't have much flavor. The Grape Nuts are more enjoyable to eat."
858,__label1__,"I got this as a gift from my wife and im not really liking the fact of walking around with a heart monitor.. but since suffering from heart failure, i know its the right thing to do.. it really works great, clear screen and i have all the needed info on it."
859,__label1__,"Overall I'm happy. Got these with some other pillows and bedding and their quality was everything I was expecting, some things better. The pillows were a little different than I expected, they are very fluffy and seemed of good quality."
860,__label1__,"These make great kitchen chairs. The cushioning is very comfortable and it doesn't look or feel like it was cheaply built. Assembling it was really easy and, since I move houses a lot, it's really easy to load onto trucks and to move into another house. The only problem I have is that I should have bought 2 more for when the guests arrive."
861,__label1__,This product is exactly as I'd expected and is perfect for what I intended to use it for -- safely storing my overwhelming amount of scarves. Just that the circles are not that smooth enough so you need to slowly pull scarves off. Overall it's great and functional.
862,__label1__,"&#34;Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems,&#34;<br />W.W.<br /><br />I was invited to spend a day with a bearded fellow who quite brimmed over with himself<br /><br />He had read my &#34;Ode to Ash Cans&#34; and was duly impressed, &#34;Call me Walt,&#34; he said<br /><br />Promise me, he did, to reveal where in the universe poems came from<br /><br />About town, he seemed to be a briny sponge, absorbing the all of our surroundings<br /><br />Wait I did patiently to be escorted by this gentlemen to the Literature's Holy Grail<br /><br />Men go to war over words, a novel stimulates not the mind, but the mindless<br /><br />We had made it down the water, a stone's throw from Fulton Ferry<br /><br />On the railing was a beetle and Walt squashed it viciously<br /><br />That is the origin of poems and the yellow Forsythia flowers yonder<br /><br />Are the death of poems and these buildings and people are the in-between poems.<br /><br />Christopher Roberts"
863,__label1__,This was my first choice however it does not fit the phone really snug. Also pressing the buttons on the phone requires mega force. The case apparently encourages dirt to come through the openings on the phone which is frustrating. These might not be such big problems any more as the issues might have been fixed.
864,__label1__,Not close to anythign for weight loss. Does not work for weight loss and I don't see how the claims and advertisements about it being a fat burner are true.
865,__label1__,"This table was designed by a respectable artist, and the design itself is great being that it is still appealing even though it was designed in the 50's. I was thinking about a replica but couldn't do it, knowing that I would be cheating the artist as well as myself by getting a inferior product."
866,__label1__,"PB2 powdered peanut butter is so sweet,i was introduced to it by my friend  and from then i cant hesitate buying it time to time,its yummy!"
867,__label1__,"This shelf was easy to put together, but the same day we filled it with books, the shelves started to sag. After just one week, the shelves were sagging almost an inch! Unfortunately, it'd be more of a hassle to disassemble it and find another large box to return it in than just buy wood, cut it and paint it for new shelves. Don't buy this if you plan on using it as a bookshelf."
868,__label1__,My hubby is no pro but he does love his games so I got him this to help him improve his performance. He seems to be using it fairly regularly too.
869,__label1__,High quality product and a tremendous value for the money. Perfect Pushup V2 Pro extends the range of your push ups and reduces the stress on your joints. Purchase this product and you won't be disappointed....
870,__label1__,"I still love this camera, the image was awesome and you can easy to set manual options. Captures the best quality of images so far!"
871,__label1__,"For a collector like me, this one is really a must have. It has nice details. The wheels, the paint job and the car itself are durable. I only tested it once because I don't really play with it. It has a pretty decent speed. Overall a great race toy that is cool, durable and fast. Definitely going on my shelf."
872,__label1__,"I am streaming music from my basement to several rooms in my house. I have been looking for a solution that allows me to distribute music wirelessly. Some of the systems that I found from Logitech and Sonos were out of my budget. Also, Logitech stopped making their product. So I gave this transmitter a try. I am very pleased with the wireless range. I was a bit concerned given the small size of the transmitter unit. However, this set performed quite well in every scenario that I tried. I have located the receiver in all of my rooms and I am getting clean reception. What I like is that I can get addition receivers to place in multiple rooms. I don't know how many transmitters can be used at the same time but apparently they use a smart pairing feature that allows several transmitters to run within the same home. I don't really need the iPod cradle but this is a nice extra feature."
873,__label1__,"Bought this to save counter space, and while it's pretty and well-made, the handle-holding bar is too short to keep spoons from falling out without applying extra effort, which often caused more of a mess. Only use it for BIG utensils as small ones fall and only good for ONE at a time."
874,__label1__,"We were disappointed by the over-all quality. The instruction manual was obviously written in very poorly translated into English, which made it difficult to understand the instructions. The quality of the actual video taken was very, very poor. Very difficult to hear recorded sound. Overall, very disappointed."
875,__label1__,The only reason we got it was because it came free with the tablet. It is really thin material and says version on the flap. If you are thinking of paying money for it I suggest you save your money
876,__label1__,"I love the look. I thought I could use in my bathroom, but than read label and can't be near moisture. must dry clean. The shimmer is really nice though.I love the look.

877,__label1__,"I've always been fascinated by the relationship between tragedy and comedy, and found this book while researching my own book on the topic. I wasn't particularly well-versed in the ""Adlerian"" method of psychology the author uses to analyze all of these guys, but actually found it to be a fascinating way to approach writing a biography. The book spends a lot of time making connections between early experiences and future behavior, and, definitely made a solid contribution to my research.!!!"
878,__label1__,Got it in black. I like it. Very roomy and perfect for a work tote. I think the sale price is plenty though. The regular price is too much. It suits my needs.
879,__label1__,"I love this product but I’m the only one who does. Everyone else has a problem with the taste for some reason. Granted, it’s not the usual super sweet variety, but that’s what I wanted in the first place."
880,__label1__,This binder is very durable and lasts forever.. I purchased my first of two around three years ago.. my first binder is like brand new minus the normal wear and tear.. Excellent product for the price.
881,__label1__,"Makes for a good movie, saw it in the theatre originally when it came out.  Wish it had more special features on this but the commentary track is nice."
882,__label1__,"It's a bit smaller that I would expect and the color is a little darker than the picture suggests, but it is very sturdy and nice. Very nice luggage!"
883,__label1__,"This conditioner smells fantastic ! It left my hair silky, smooth and hydrated. It's not greasy or weighed down."
884,__label1__,"Purchased this bed to create more room in my son's bedroom. Perfect! Went together well. Real wood, sturdy and I love the finish. It does get dinged easily (vacuum-oops) the only thing is that once the bed is put together the ladder doesn't move to be cleaned under."
885,__label1__,We're renovating one of our B&B suites and put this in a walk in shower room. The fan is great at is the heating and lighting and the wall switch is slick looking. It installed easily and looks wonderful.
886,__label1__,"This pump shaft is a good replacement part for machines that provide or dispense water, like wells, filters, and the like. The size is just perfect for all uses. I am loving this."
887,__label1__,"My husband and I tried All Natural Stevia for the first and are very pleased with it. It has no additives. We did buy a shaker that has very small holes as this Stevia is so fine it doesn't require much to taste it. So many other powders have inulin in them and we understand it is derived from corn which my husband is allergic to, and which may be genetically altered."
888,__label1__,Excellent quality. It's very helpful when your car's need start require help from another battery. Easy use and strong performance on my van.
889,__label1__,"We use these fans in all our bathroom remodels, they are the best fans on the market. They are quiet and effective. I recommend these fans to anyone upgrading or adding an exhaust fan."
890,__label1__,This was just kinda plain. Half the bottle and nothing. It upset my stomach when I took more than 1 pill on any empty stomach. I think it may have been the additives they put into it which are not so good. I have never had heart burn before but now I do.
891,__label1__,"Not much to say other than it is eactly what they advertise. I'd like to say the lead doesn't break as often as the other competitor #2 pencils, but I am not 100% certain. It sharpens well and erases well. I recommend this Dixon. BRING THE SCANTRONS!"
892,__label1__,"For the price, its an okay tablet. You are limited to the amount of memory your given and you can't do as much. The apple iPad mini in my opinion is the way to go.

I was looking for certain designs and it is hard to pick out stuff like this on the internet. I had no way to get to a craft shop, so I chose Amazon for my supplies. While I think I have a lot of nice things to work with for the decorations I plan to make, some of the patterns I want to use from this collection I can't because it is on the opposite side of another one I want to use. If Amazon adds more pictures, showing the front and backs of the papers, they could help customers and make extra sales from people like me who would benefit from two packs, in order to use all of the designs we'd like."

909,__label1__,"Interesting book. It is better than &#34;Predictably Irrational.&#34; Indeed, people are often irrational, but sometimes what appears to be rational is not. But even in this book, Ariely misses one of the obvious and major reasons people make SEEMINGLY irrational decisions, that are actually quite reasonable and rational from an individual perspective. Our government has increasingly alienated people from individual responsibility and from other citizens, and it has taken the risk out of making decisions.<br /><br />As long as they receive government benefits and hand-outs, most citizens will not look behind the &#34;wizard's curtain.&#34; Nevertheless, modern U.S. Government is unlike any before. Citizens can observe that government is now nothing more than an unsustainable Ponzi scheme. A broad tax base of new taxpayers is needed every year just to pay basic government expenses. Yet, each year, the tax base shrinks (population of taxpayers decreases) and government expenses rise. In the face of this disaster, has government made an all-out effort to cut expenses? Of course not. Government is raising taxes to dangerous and debilitating levels, borrowing huge amounts of money from foreigners, and INCREASING EXPENSES. Obama has quadrupled-down on failure, creating the largest deficit ever. If a private citizen or corporation ran its affairs in this manner, it would be criminally procescuted for fraud.<br /><br />Citizens have internalized the government's ongoing propaganda-of-irresponsibility, and they observe the government's example of irrationality and emotionalism. And now the People are behaving just like their government. This is what government &#34;nudging&#34; has created.<br /><br />For over 60 years now, citizens have been detached from the effects of their negative decisions, whether concerning lifestyle or the effects of bad financial choices. With a constant barrage of government-sponsored propaganda; emotionalism and group-politics have replaced rationality as the bases for decision-making. And modern U.S. government propaganda is the most effective in history, as it employs all the lessons learned and techniques of behavior manipulation from the disciplines of sociology, psychological warfare, and psychology over the past 100 years. There are ongoing propaganda programs promoting and encouraging government provided medical care, unemployment insurance, welfare and social security benefits, free monthly income even for young people, and the chance of filing a lawsuit or getting the government involved when investments go bad. The government conditions citizens to incorrectly believe that correlation is the same as causation; and that appearances and emotional intent are the same as results. The government's goal: promote reliance on government and avoidance of individual responsibility, thought and judgment. Why? To insure ease of public manipulation and the political power of certain groups. Obama oligarch, Cass Sunstein, refers to this conditioning, manipulation and control of citizens as &#34;nudging.&#34;<br /><br />For example, during the recent &#34;subprime mortgage crisis,&#34; which Ariely cites as an example of irrationality, all parties behaved rationally and reasonably, EXCEPT the supposedly rational U.S. Government. Homeowners who could not afford houses knew the government was guaranteeing the loans and, given their minimal down payments, they knew they had little to lose from foreclosure if they could not make payments. Thus, it made perfect sense from their perspective to risk buying homes they could not afford. Similarly, lenders knew the loans were government guaranteed, and the government was threatening lenders with lawsuits and fines if they did not make loans to unqualified buyers, so the lenders knew they had little risk in making imprudent loans. In fact, lenders faced greater risk from government harassment if they did NOT make imprudent loans. Investors in those loans also acted rationally. They understood, correctly, that the government would not allow homeowners, lenders and investors to lose billions or trillions of dollars on a program the government forced on the country. Thus, investors bought loans they knew would probably go into default, because, even if they received no payments from borrowers, the government would rescue financial institutions and investors, which it did. Finally, the only party that did not act rationally was the U.S. government. First, it &#34;incentivized&#34; imprudent economic activity by taking the risk from lenders, borrowers and investors. Then, to make matters much worse, it actually rewarded and has now promoted imprudent financial activity by rescuing all parties to the government created mortgage &#34;crisis.&#34;<br /><br />Over the past 60 years, governments have aggressively promoted irrational risk-taking (which is actually rational for the individual, since he risks nothing), which has spread to all areas of individual human endeavor. Citizens are increasingly losing their good judgment, since the world in which they live is a fiction created by the government, bearing no relation to the real world of finance, economics, and survival based on good decisions. Thus, contrary to Ariely's thesis, the forces of &#34;irrationality&#34; are not hidden. Irrationality is a necessary part of modern government. In fact, many of the programs created by the government have the irrational and exact opposite effect than the one intended. For example, the 1960s &#34;Great Society&#34; and &#34;War on Poverty,&#34; created more poverty. The War on Gun Ownership has resulted in more violence by criminals. The welfare system designed to help families, destroyed families, and created several generations of illegitimate children. Despite billions spent on education; Math, Science and intelligence testing scores are in decline. This is because foolish government bureaucrats and academics have confused correlation with causation. Education does not make people successful. Rather, successful, intelligent people are more likely to finish their education and continue on with their successful lives. It is a waste of money to try to over-educate an unintelligent individual, who should be directed to trade training. Instead, politicians tell us it is preferable students receive diluted, fake degrees. Amazingly, not only does the government not encourage the most intelligent and productive citizens to have children, but instead, the government now subsidizes and promotes the breeding of the least intelligent inhabitants of the country. Incredibly, in many cases, the people receiving these breeding subsidies are not even citizens! There is insufficient space here for a complete list of government irrationalities.<br /><br />It is enough to note that modern government employs techniques similar to the &#34;Cargo Cult&#34; islanders who, by using sympathetic magic, thought that creating the superficial appearances of a system (fake airport and planes), would bring material reward (delivery of cargo). Like modern politicians, the Cargo Cult confused correlation with causation. Citizens have learned the lessons of government irrationality and it has conditioned individual behavior. Many academics and intellectuals, such as Ariely, have lost sight of the fact that human beings are animals that respond in ways that are similar to organisms and other animals. That is, they seek the easiest path to satisfaction of needs and emotions, and avoid effort and thought whenever possible. This is particularly true of individuals subjected to prolonged government propaganda campaigns. Government cannot force one to be successful, but it can set up conditions promoting irrationality and failure, as the U.S. has done. The best antidote to predictable government irrationality is to place individuals back in touch with reality, that is, with the true effects of their decisions. Despite Ariely's faulty analysis, hedoes unwittingly show the many ways in which government directly and indirectly promotes irrationality."

It's a huge waste of time.<br /><br />You've been warned."
978,__label1__,"When I got the package I was so happy but when I opened it, I was very disappointed when I saw the item. In the picture it's shiny and very nice looking. The reason I purchased this product was because its cheap and the picture is good looking. What do you expect for a cheap product?"
979,__label1__,"Case arrived quickly, the case itself is a perfect armor for galaxy s6, only issue is there was a scratch on the case, I guess it was scratched during transit, not big issue tho."
980,__label1__,"I have to leave the bed cover open becasue, once the fuel cans were full and could not be laid on their side, the fill nozzles were higher than the cover would allow.  Sounds good~!"
981,__label1__,"This is everything you expect in a duffel bag. It is light weight, has lots of zippers and you can get easy access into the guts of it. I like it because it is plain looking. I like that and so does another hundred people at the baggage claim. You want to put a big band sticker on your bag to find it easily. Or a big screaming patch. The bag is great though."
982,__label1__,"The luggage itself is massive, can hold a lot of things. The hard shell is strong and protects items inside quite well. It is light, but not the lightest.<br /><br />If you are prefer lighter weight, you should try the following instead.<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CXYKQOG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00CXYKQOG&linkCode=as2&tag=justckem-20"
983,__label1__,"I don't know why people are dissing this laptop. I've had it for 3 years and the battery is still great. I even use this for gaming and it still runs smoothly. I had problems with it when I first bought it. The charging circuit wouldn't work and they had to replace it. But after that, it ran smoothly. The laptop can run Adobe Photoshop CS5 but lags a little. It's good enough for a student like me. 3 years ago, laptops were pricey and this fit my budget.<br /><br />My Cons:<br />It's too damn heavy if you want to bring it anywhere. My back hurts a lot after carrying it the whole day. It heats up really fast if you're gaming or programming. I actually got burns before when it got too hot and it was seated in my lap. The touchpad is annoying too, sometimes it moves itself even if I'm not even near it, but it happens rarely."
984,__label1__,We just bought this but so far it's been great. I bought this for my son and he thinks the flames are &#34;cool.&#34; It's easy to get him buckled and he can pretty much do it by himself. The only thing I wish it had was a cup holder but we bought this for our second vehicle so we probably wouldn't use that much anyways.
985,__label1__,"I like the way this cologne smells, as does my girlfriend. But if fades too quickly and it's a hassle to have to reapply every couple of hours just to have it fade again. I won't be buying anymore of this once this bottle is gone."
986,__label1__,"Every time I heated this particular soup in any microwave, the container made a popping sound and popped up off the turning tray, fell over, and spilled out. If you can catch it before it spills over completely, you will find when eating that the noodles all gravitate to the bottom and you are left with a very untasty, pasty noodle mash at the end of the serving."
987,__label1__,"My phone is not able to recognize this card sometimes. and when it does, the transfer speed is terrible. Therefore, I tried to exchange this product but their refund&exchange policy is a night mare. I am very disappointed with it, even if the price is quite good."

989,__label1__,I bought this to use for only my undergarments and after a couple of months it completely fell apart. It started getting stuck on one drawer and on the other completely came off the hinges. A complete waste of money.
990,__label1__,"The RTX is a great tool. For those interested the Dremel flex shaft fits the RTX regardless of what Dremel will try and tell you. The soft case is a pain but it is a case as long as the tool performs well I am happy and it does. It has more then three speeds as there are selections in between the three main speeds. Again, great product!"
991,__label1__,"Adeline Yen Mah tells an interesting story of culture, abuse, and commitment. This was a new look for me at Chinese heritage. As a daughter from a wealthy Chinese family, she gives insight into the abuse that knows no economic boundary. She had a cruel Eurasian mother that added a whole new element to the traditional family. Adeline eventually moves from China to England and then to the US while trying to preserve her family ties back home. It was an interesting look at three cultures and how they affect our image of family. It was an interesting read but be prepared for a terribly abusive story."
992,__label1__,"I am trying to control my dog who hasn't learned obedience commands is exhausting and often nearly impossible. But teaching him simple commands from this book will make a world of difference and provide a great opportunity for bonding. So thankful for this book that is so much helpful. I have learned to keep in mind that puppies have short attention spans, and it is unreasonable to expect to have your puppy's full attention for a long period of time. Keep your sessions short at first to minimize distractions and maintain your dog's attention, gradually increasing the amount of time spent on training each day."
993,__label1__,I think that I did something wrong that bubbles were coming out on the second day after me and my girlfriend stuck this into her kitchen wall.<br />but anyway it was great while it lasted sadly for us just a few days after my girlfriend bought it.
994,__label1__,"i am reviewing this product after 1 year of use , best MP3 player for the given price. no problem till now!"
995,__label1__,"Here is my take on this shampoo: It is just a regular shampoo that is expensive. It didn't do a thing to my hair. Same before, same after. I do like the smell of it but that alone is not enough to justified the expensive price tag. If this is cheaper, I'll probably buy it again, but I can't afford it."
996,__label1__,"What really matters I guess is that my son loves it, but I feel like stomping on it when he leaves it hanging around and it goes off by itself. Oh well."
997,__label1__,"This food is great! My baby has always loved it! Very easy to travel with, easy to warm up, easy to store. It is a little expensive, but you get what you pay in my opinion."

999,__label1__,"I lost a lot of weight taking these raspberry ketones, but I really wanted to lose it faster than this. I expected something like 50 pounds in a couple of months and instead I only lost 28 pounds in two months. I know that is still A LOT.<br /><br />On the other hand I never lost so much weight before as I did by taking this supplement. I didn't have a single side effect. No headaches, diarrhea or chest pains like other weight loss stuff make you have. Oh and I didn't have flatulence either. Some other pills I took caused me that a lot.<br /><br />So, this is actually a great product, I'm just an impatient guy. It took me years to get this fat and I want to get rid of it in months. I know that is crazy and it is my fault not the products.<br /><br />I think people should buy it and be patient with it. Even if it takes three months to lose all the weight it is worth it because you live longer when you lose the weight and are thin. Thin people don't get some diseases as often as fat people do. You don't get diabetes type II and you don't get high blood pressure as often.<br /><br />If people in your family have that stuff you need to be thin to not get it. So, buy these raspberry ketones before it is too late for your health."

For the price, I expected it to last longer than it has. It has never been dropped or misused in anyway. I would not recommend it to anyone and will never purchase another one."
1001,__label1__,I have been a fan of tarot cards for many years and this book helped me learn even more about reading the cards.
1002,__label1__,Oh my! This is the one I was looking for! I love how this USB is designed with its classy and simple design.  I was wondering where to buy it since my friend said he bought this one in the mall but unfortunately it was out of stock. But then thanks to Google I ended up in Amazon and I finally found it! Got my product just today and it was perfect!
1003,__label1__,Nice way to gather stuffed animals. Used regular nails instead of all the &#34;hardware&#34; that came with it and have had no trouble with it staying put.
1004,__label1__,"This book is really well-written. Informative, clear, easy to understand. Need a better flow though."
1005,__label1__,Beautiful looking table. But after playing on it for a week I noticed a bubble on the felt. After taking the table apart. Seen how the felt was put on. Board then some kind of laminates then the felt. But the felt is cut to fit just the top. Not wrapped under. Disappointing.
1006,__label1__,"it does look like the photo, it just came all folded up and still has some creases. It also smelled really bad."
1007,__label1__,"I got one of these to stamp on bulshTT ""Tps reports"" and other junk that people put on my desk. My office has the worst beurocracy of paperwork. We stamp most things with CRAP. LOL!"

1009,__label1__,"Meh, I've used better. I should have read the other negative reviews before ordering. Feel very cheap and not a very good price."
1010,__label1__,What a great read!  The author paints a beautiful backdrop to a thrilling story line as you travel with the characters from California to Texas to Hawaii.  Lots of flying woven throughout.  I couldn't wait to get to the next page.
1011,__label1__,"This liner would be great if it wasn't too wide and too short. I have to hang my curtain rod lower than I would, so that this liner fits properly"
1012,__label1__,"I don't know why I never had these installed before. No more hanging lingerie and bathing suits over the actual shower bar. Now I have my very own indoor clothesline. The metal finish is lovely, and it works well. Hooray."
1013,__label1__,"If you like the BEP, then you will like this DVD.<br />They are not at their best, but even then, they do put on a really good and entertaining show.<br />Their later live performances evolved, and are much better."
1014,__label1__,"Not happy with the scratches. It distracts from the cake, at least in my opinion. No one else seems to notice it."
1015,__label1__,Work as expected - Little fiddly to fit onto the ear. Some assistance requited the first few times.<br />Battery life is good.<br />Nice bass levels.<br />Also works really well for calls.
1016,__label1__,"It feels nice and is fairly quiet as it says but mine is defective. It randomly types capital letters, wakes my computer from sleep with other dysfunctions."
1017,__label1__,If you are going to spend this much get something quality like GlamGlow Mud.  The container is cheap and the product is low quality. Smaller than I thought!
1018,__label1__,"This was a gift for my daughter and so far they are meeting her needs. She is a college student and needed something that wouldn't break and was ""LOUD"". I checked them out when I visited her and they are pretty good for the price can't complain."
1019,__label1__,"Not bad! It still tastes amazing, though that might be because I'm a huge tootsie roll fan. On the other hand, our local store just stocked up on this and it's much cheaper there too, so I guess I know where I'm getting my supply from now on."
1020,__label1__,"I don't like about the product was the shape of the utensils. I have to get used to the shape and I didn't notice until after I purchased them that it doesn't come with a fork utensil. A lot odd pieces, but Very cheap quality. If I knew I wouldn't buy."
1021,__label1__,I purchased this drive because a friend of mine said Samsung makes quality SSD's. It's fast and the price was OK.
1022,__label1__,"The thing which I did not like, is that as a women's backpack it is a little smaller than what I'm used to from regular backpacks. The shoulder straps are nicely cushioned, though."
1023,__label1__,"junk ---pipe pulls right out every time . top seal from tank cap leaks everytime,,u could only spray downwards cant spray upwards with this .. i would not buy this again ."
1024,__label1__,I ought this for my son and he loved it. It's perfect for his not-too-big room and the sound quality is great. I can hear some decent bass too. Guess it's a steal!
1025,__label1__,"Nothing new in this book , if you already have read something in how to master your financial life this book will not be a much help for you."
1026,__label1__,"I am nnoyed by he fact that this chair squeezes a lot: when I sit down on it and when I get up. It becomes annoying after a couple of days of intense use. The materials are pretty cheap, also. The design is nice."
1027,__label1__,"I was a long time proactive user, but didn't care for their customer service and wanted something cheaper. This system claims to be half the price of proactive, but since it comes in smaller containers, that aren't exactly true."
1028,__label1__,It's very hard to find a keyboard protector for my laptop model so I settled for a universal one. I just use it as a temporary protection when I eat and drink while I work but remove right after I finish gobbling and gulping because I can't see very well through it. Works it purpose for me.
1029,__label1__,"This is a really comfy blanket, but when I took it out of the package there were two holes big enough to put my finger through."
1030,__label1__,"I am using this headphone for a month,it delivers good clarity.The bass quality is above average and treble dominates but it gives the quality sound worth for its price.so it is worth buying."
1031,__label1__,"I did not buy this product because the price is just way too high and it does not make sense to get just a single pad of this notebook. If they're going to charge high anyway, they might as well sell them by the bundle or something."
1032,__label1__,This amplifier seemed like the perfect solution for my problem. I wanted an integrated solution to stream music from my iPhone to a pair of floor-standing speakers wirelessly. My speakers do not have wireless and I did not like having a separate wireless receiver and amplifier. Since my phone supports Bluetooth I gave this amp a try.<br /><br />It worked as long as the distance between my phone and speakers was within 20 feet before cutting out. The build quality seems a bit cheap but for the price I guess that is what you get.<br /><br />The real bummer however was the fact that there is a constant hiss in the audio. I think this hiss is generated by the amplifier itself. If I turn down the volume the hiss goes down. If I turn it up the hiss comes back. This is very annoying since I otherwise would have liked this product. Unfortunately this constant white noise is driving me crazy. I have since returned this unit and purchased a similar product from another vendor.
1033,__label1__,"I thought I would like it better once it arrived but it's just not my style. However, the black in it goes very well with my espresso vanity."
1034,__label1__,It gives a touch capability with new experience to interact with the world.The only thing that I have a problem is the fact that the laptop that is shown in the pictures shows that the laptop has a CD drive but mine did not come with one. I now know not to go off what I see in the picture because the picture is just something to draw you in more. So check specifications before going to order.
1035,__label1__,Either I really don't know what I'm looking for or this thing doesn't really make much of a difference for me.
1036,__label1__,I've always trusted amazon sell original and quality products. I knew I was right. The battery came exactly as expected and exactly as shown on the picture
1037,__label1__,My complaint is that the plastic protector for the head of the razor did not fit properly and has now cracked. I taped it back together. The manufacturer needs to redesign it so it fits better.
1038,__label1__,"It's amazing! I started using this and my friends really noticed this wonderful scarf, A lot of compliments I received this day."
1039,__label1__,I gave this to my sister who just graduated from high school and was going to a state college and she was surprised at some of the information found here.
1040,__label1__,"adhesives stick well on the wall. holds the keys properly. but when placed with a huge bunch of keys, the keys tend to slide from the hook."
1041,__label1__,I've been wearing this watch for about two weeks now and love it! I like the balance of gold and silver tones on the watch band design as I had a difficult time finding a two tone watch with a balance of both colors.
1042,__label1__,"Well for me, this is a great deal. I am satisfied with it and I don't have any issue using it. I will buy another one for my granny."
1043,__label1__,"This swim cap for long hair is good, I like the design and quality. So far I haven't encountered any problems using it. I would recommend it to anyone."
1044,__label1__,"This is first time trying it, and it's feel easy to use, and it will tell us when to turn on, when it got heated enough to get started."
1045,__label1__,I was originally planning on buying the crib bedding set but I am glad I found this! It looks JUST like the Jacana set but MUCH cheaper and comes with more. The quality cannot compete with the other crib bedding set which I got before.
1046,__label1__,"I bought this briefcase to travel issue, Actually I put hundred of thing inside it :D<br />it's really great one, Hard material."
1047,__label1__,"Very disappointed in this product. If it is supposed to have no harmful preservatives, then why do they contain chemicals that can cause allergic reactions. The next thing is all those ridiculous amount of five star reviews that are clearly paid for. Bad stuff, don't buy it."
1048,__label1__,"tossed out the bottle after using this for 2 week. ONLY MADE MY HAIR loss worse and only left my hair SLIMIER after using it. looking back, most reviews posted seem FAKE I cant believe I feel for this. STAY AWAY!"
1049,__label1__,"Great design, they fit really well in the ear which is very important, and it's light. but all that don't amount to much if you have a hard time hearing from it. it got really worst when i used it a couple of times doing my morning runs. Perhaps I had a lemon but as far as my unit goes it just won't do for me."
1050,__label1__,"After washing my hair with this my hair felt like hay! And afterwards when dry, it looked dried out and frizzy. I will never buy this again. Waste of my money."
1051,__label1__,I purchased this as an upgrade for my brother in law's computer. It performs well enough that he can now play his games on his computer. For a basic gamer or just anyone that made the unfortunate mistake of purchasing a slim computer I would highly recommend this card.
1052,__label1__,wouldn't recommend this one to anybody. the sensors are a bit slow and i have to repeatedly touch them for the sensors to work. but it fits our small bedside tables well.
1053,__label1__,"I would usually go for the fish oils. Of course the brand is always a lower price. I am unsure about how the quality compares. These are just as they say and I haven't had problems with the ""fish oil burps"" after taking them. That's about all I can say. I have been using Fish Oil since it has been deemed a healthy addition to one's diet. The only thing better than a good product is a good, cost effective product."
1054,__label1__,I did not expect that it was too small. However the product still serves its purpose. Quality is not that satisfying. Product is just okay.
1055,__label1__,"I have tried many different phone mounts for my phone and this one is the first one that has worked. In fact, it's been perfect. After using this for few months in my car, I found its most redeeming feature is its ability to suction onto different kind of surface (uneven, textured) of my car dash. I shouldn't be messing with phone while driving anyway!"
1056,__label1__,"This is a great tool. The glue stick melts very quickly and does not require to be pushed down like my old glue gun. It goes down smoothly in itself, making me finish my craft a hell lot faster!!!"
1057,__label1__,It's a BBQ tong and does what a BBQ tong does. I suppose that's a compliment these days where a lot of tongs don't do what tongs are supposed to do.
1058,__label1__,I have purchased this product about two months ago and since then I'm using the spare batteries and I'm satisfied but still there is a problem as one battery gives the best backup and the other one is not good and gives the poor battery lifetime and that really disappoints.
1059,__label1__,"The charger is perfect for my needs. It has ample power and is convenient to carry around. I charge my iPhone and office phone (HTC Thunderbolt) with this and I can probably get at least a full charge for both phones from it. I have tried it on separate occasions and so far, I have not been able to get even 4000 mAh from it. Not a big deal for me because a full charge for each phone is all I need when traveling. But if you are counting on the full capacity as advertised, know that it is really more like 4k or so (roughly). Still pretty good given the compact size in my opinion."
1060,__label1__,We were a bit disappointed because we have to change the filters immediately. However this product works as advertised and the shipment and delivery was impressive.
1061,__label1__,Can't beat the price. Good quality and sounds great. I'm really enjoying it. Perfect guitar for a starter.
1062,__label1__,I really like the curtains specially the colors. My daughter used them at a party she hosted. It was a success! Quality not all that great but then they are not for regular use.
1063,__label1__,"I used this stuff before..... you know, it works wonders for me and myself and my partner had some great night together, I give it 3 stars because I am always tired once I'm done."
1064,__label1__,"This arrived in a nice package. It works great but the wifi coverage is horrible by comparison to the linksys that I replaced with this. Saves on monthly lease fee from my cable provider, though."
1065,__label1__,"My cat is warming up to this water....he is suspicious, as most cats will e....but following he directions I have old water bowl out and not running the pet fountain will he starts drinking rom it. It is going to be a great saver 4 me....I want my cat todrink more and I think this will really be the trick to that."
1066,__label1__,I got this bag after realizing my old sling purse was wearing out. I had high expectations because my old purse was so great. This bag has held up well. I carry a lot of things and this bag has so much room! The strap is just right. I just carry in on one shoulder though if you want it to go across your body you might look for a different bag.
1067,__label1__,I bought this for my adult daughter and was going to load it up with pictures and music. The music part was great but the display for the pictures was so bad that it was verually a waist of time. Looking at the engine of my Victory was just a blob of crome and black. No detail at all. Couldn't see any individual cooling fins.
1068,__label1__,This is a great book for dietbetics. I thought medicine was the only way to treat my condition for years. I didn't think it could be fixed through diet but it can. I love the way this book describes how to change your life. change is hard and it can be a little depressing at times.
1069,__label1__,"This has short cords, so I got to supply an extension for it. However, having a remote is nice. It has great lows, good mid and highs. So far, I like it."
1070,__label1__,"For only this is a very great scope, and very Accurate once you get done with the hassle of Sighting it in, but Overall I love it and would Definitely recommend this to a friend an only 4 stars because you can always Improve on something"
1071,__label1__,"I choose probotics because I would often see ads and commercial on how probotics where good for your health however after taking probotics for 7 days  i have a felt no changes in my bowels or the way i felt, I am saying that i did not dislike the product I am saying that probotics did nothing to improve myself.<br />i would recommend probotics to anyone who is willing to give it a try it might help them, but it did not work for me."
1072,__label1__,"Great book .I enjoyed this book.Brilliance is an exciting &#34;futuristic&#34; story that could easily have taken place today. A fun read, can't wait to start the 2nd novel."
1073,__label1__,"My son loved Dora so much that I decided to support and encourage his interest. Compared to some of the programs I've seen this one comes with a lot more content. All the content fits together. The DVD's work well with the songs on the Audio CD, the flashcards work well with the memory game and we look at the book every night before bed. Well worth the money..."
1074,__label1__,You can use this for any lens or glass that needs cleaning really. It's effective and cheap. That's why we like it.
1075,__label1__,These chews appear to be a great dental solution for my dogs. There is a bit of inconsistency with the size of the strips and be careful as to where your dog works on them as they will stain carpets. Overall the chews seem to do a good job at cleaning their teeth and breathe.
1076,__label1__,My cats like the food but my wallet does not like the continually climbing prices. For the first year I bought this the price was pretty stable but it is now going up every month or every other month. Too expensive. I suggest shopping around a bit - there's bound to be a better deal somewhere on the Internet.
1077,__label1__,Purchased this for my son's room. His about to attend school and when I saw this I figured this is the perfect desk for him. He's already going on and on about school and he felt like he's really a student now because he has his own desk.
1078,__label1__,"Best sunglasses I ever bought, I sat on them twice, dropped them in a river, and they hold up, when I put them on I feel like I can see everything in HD, lens pops out for easy cleaning, ultra light weight, adjustable for abnormal nose sizes."
1079,__label1__,My German shepherd absolutely loves this! My stuff has been officially tooth mark-free for the first time in a very long time.
1080,__label1__,"for my project i had to do some community work,cleaning the city for a month was not an easy job and i had to protect myself from the dust in the city,i purchased 3m dust respirator and rhey served me throughout my project."
1081,__label1__,Legion is a good tasting supplement but it does not do anything for me as far as pumps. I have no extra energy. It's almost like drinking a really good tasting soda pop without the fizz.
1082,__label1__,we have a farm and this is going to be used around the machinery shed to keep those pesky black birds out
1083,__label1__,This is one of the cheaper routers out there. I would suggest going for one that is a little bit more that will last a lot longer and work 10x better.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AZP8EW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001AZP8EW&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwworkoutwei-20
1084,__label1__,If evaluated for what it is - an energy bar - this measures up to my expectations. I carry this in my bag for emergency energy when I'm traveling or otherwise unable to get regular food. The flavor and texture are very satisfying and it doesn't leave a metallic aftertaste as some bars do. The texture is not too dense or overly crunchy - just the right balance.
1085,__label1__,"Too soft, not enough stability. Loved the fact that it was a pillow top, however, I like to sit up in bed, which is not conducive with this mattress; unless, of course, you want to feel like you are sinking."
1086,__label1__,"I ordered this because I love latex pillows and have been trying to find a good match to one I have at home that is on its' last legs. This pillow is airy and comfy, but thicker than I'd hoped for :( It does have a very weird odor as everyone else has mentioned- I aired it out outside and then put an older, recently used pillowcase on top of it. The smell didn't bother me when I went to sleep, and seemed to have disappeared almost immediately- I've had the pillow for about a month now. I like enough to keep it, but I will not buy it again unless it comes in a thinner width."
1087,__label1__,The child unit doesn't mount to the wall so unless you have a tall piece of furniture to sit it on you're kind of out of luck. There is a major delay between the child and parental unit. We can hear our daughter cry out from her room before the monitor picks
1088,__label1__,"To say this book is useful to all is an understatement, but unfortunately not everyone thinks that way.

If you want to help yourself out in life check this out, do the exercises, just give it your best shot, but actually try."
1089,__label1__,"I don't really see a difference in my hair. I've been taking it almost a month, so maybe I need to give it a little more time."
1090,__label1__,"This is sadly a horrible product. I've been encountering problems using this. First, it sometimes won't read and those are times I go panicking, thinking it needed to be reformatted. Second, it got some scratches and that's really disappointing. It got me thinking that this is cheaply made yet expensive. Not worth it really."
1091,__label1__,It is a messy product. It stains my shirt and pillow. It makes me itchy like crazy. I will feel better if it worked for me. But it didn't after over four months.
1092,__label1__,Very good sound for the price I paid. Was amazed at how powerful the speakers were. I use these for my laptop. It came in handy watching movies and listening to music.
1093,__label1__,"Very useful product for cleaning PC, windows, curtains. Its a do it yourself easy product for house wives and home makers."
1094,__label1__,"This is the second piece that I have ordered from them and again I was pleasantly surprised! It did however have a small dent on top, but for the price and the fact that it will be covered anyway, it wasn't worth returning."
1095,__label1__,"I used to build for fun and profit, now I just build because I'm ready for a new machine. I don't want to tinker much, I'm looking for reliability and stability."
1096,__label1__,"As much as I like my galaxy tab, I needed a real keyboard to do the emails - touch screen just doesn't cut it. These keyboards are perfect for that purpose. The case fits the galaxy tab perfectly. The keyboard connected to the tablet without any glitch although you can see the instructions are written by someone whose native language is not English. I also like the fact that keyboard can be removed from the case making it less bulky if you wish so!"
1097,__label1__,The bows are of poor quality and colors seem dull in comparison to what is shown on picture.  I was hoping that it will look much brighter and cheery.
1098,__label1__,"I feel like the product was falsely advertised. Even if the cord works, it does not allow you to connect a computer to a TV.  Just don't work, from Video camera out put RCA to the Monitor."
1099,__label1__,"Speakers sound like crap when there up too loud. Also, when plugging in my headphones into the headphone socket about 7 or 8 times, the headphone socket caved inside the construction of the speaker! Save up more and buy a better set, Go with Creative or Altec Lansing."
1100,__label1__,"Even with constant use, this product has not displayed any damage or wear. The distribution of the marinade has been amazing as well, so each meat has the same amount of flavor and thus consistent with what we promise."
1101,__label1__,My husband is a big guy so I figured XL would be adequate. Wrong. I did end up gifting this to my son and he is happy with it. Hope it didn't shrink or he doesn't gain any weight though or it will not fit.
1102,__label1__,"I wanted a red mouse pad for my red mouse. Too bad it wasn't available in store as it was a waste of a rather large box and packing material. I have what you call a red room. I have a red futon, from here. Red valences and red lamps. So I now have everything."
1103,__label1__,"I was initially a little unsure about buying a new product rather than going for old school razer and steel series. But then, I went along and took the risk. And I got worth my money. Large, smooth, elegant with great texture and design. Yes you can get better if you are willing to spend more, but at this price, it's awesome."
1104,__label1__,This design is ugly and the lines going around do not connect and the painting is sloppy. They are very large. The only thing i do like is that they are lightweight
1105,__label1__,I wore a sexy evening gown that's why I purchased this push-up bra breast pad. I'm comfortable wearing it all throughout the night. I love it!
1106,__label1__,I got this for my '03 Honda because my lights were starting to get dim when I drove at night. It works great. I would say my headlights are 10 times clearer than before. When I saw the picture at first I thought it would be very hard to use but it wasn't at all. It comes with everything you need and this one is very affordable I'm impressed.
1107,__label1__,"So for the pros first:<br /><br />I use it on my face as an night time moisturizer and it seems to do the trick well. Absorbs and keeps my face hydrated.<br /><br />However, my intention was using this as a hair product. I am already currently using my night cream for my face at night which does an amazing job also and is slightly cheaper.<br /><br />As for hair product, I am switching from the blue label Moroccan oil to this and this one is oily and doesn't help with frizz as much.<br /><br />That is the reason for 2 star because I did not get to use it for what I want to."
1108,__label1__,It's a very great value for the price. It's a well-made medicine ball that's perfect in shape and size and weight.
1109,__label1__,Looking at the picture online I was a little hesitant to purchase this item. I was very happy when I received it. It looks so much better than I thought it would. It is the perfect album for my daughter's scrapbook!
1110,__label1__,This oil is junk!<br />I don't think it is high quality because of the foul smell. And I don't see any difference in my skin after a week of using it. Stick with another brand and you'll see the results.
1111,__label1__,"It looks fine  on the phone and it is easy to remove. I would trust to to protect against falls, but to help reduce small dings while it sits on my desk, rides in my car, or is carried in my pocket to keep out dust and lint, then yes, it is good for that."
1112,__label1__,Alarm won't sound when tested. Had a friend look at it and he confirmed that it was defective. He suggested that I stick with Kidde or First Alert.
1113,__label1__,"It took me an hour to finally install Ooma Telo on a place where my phone was. I didn't think of calling a support because I read here that they were not that helpful. Once I installed it, I called a friend just to see if it works ( prior to that I had to activate product through their website, which was an annoying process). However, friend told me that he couldn't hear me well and that he noticed a repeat of every word I say. I didn't knew what happened, since I updated software online to the newest version, so we changed places and I got onto his phone and he on Ooma. I noticed the same thing, low volume and slight delay, which really ruined the whole experience. At last I returned the item and made a fair exchange...<br /><br />I got myself a new Telo Home Service ( http://amzn.to/1vBqHZ5 ), which wasn't malfunctioned. I did had slight problems in installing it but I solved it as it wasn't a factory mistake. It worked like a clock, so I'll stick to it for now on."
1114,__label1__,This product is not a good buy. The instructions are not clear and concise. I was not able to hang my TV with this product because of the unclear instructions. I would not recommend buying this product.
1115,__label1__,"although i wasn't expecting a lot because of how cheap i bought these towels, still i didn't think that the threads would easily loosen up at the edges after two washes. it's comfortable and soft. but the color is off. it's not as how it was pictured. it's more of light grey."
1116,__label1__,"I keep this umbrella in the back of my car and it's really nice quality, looks much more expensive than it is and haven't found a problem with it yet. I went back and ordered another one, I liked it so much."
1117,__label1__,"so far it has been really easy and nice..just love it nice gift from my uncle.<br />Awesome does what it says!, Excellent product!"
1118,__label1__,"Was all excited to get new memory foam mattress, it is too soft. I read all the reviews, read on how much wt. But it is not what I wanted .My wife, and I are disappointed. We are out the money for you cannot return once opened, but you can't try it if you don't open it. Looks nice just already feels broke down."
1119,__label1__,"The third and last book of Dave Pelzer's retelling of his experiences as he searched his way to recovery and total forgiveness. He knows he cannot change his past but he must do something to vindicate himself especially his mother... and father. He will learn this the hard way and he will become a father himself. More than forgiveness, this novel brings hope to those who are suffering similar child abuse traumas.<br />Along one's road to recovery are people who will make you feel right about yourself, notwithstanding your dark past. There are good people and people who had it worse in the past don't necessarily have to be wicked."
1120,__label1__,Works just as well as my $17 capo.  I keep it handy as a spare so when we have impromtu guests who wants to jam we have something to offer.
1121,__label1__,"I love potatoes.<br />I bought olive oil because I always put it to my boiled potatoes.<br />I ate potatoes as a replacement with burgers and fries.<br />Together with olive oil, I always have an awesome meal!"
1122,__label1__,"Thanks to this book I've lost 13 pounds in 10 days. But be very careful later, if you don't pay attention what and how much you eat you'll easily get that weight back."
1123,__label1__,"Bought this to travel with-it is just the right size and helps to keep up with the family at home and work. However, the processer isn't very fast.

1124,__label1__,"I was somewhat disappointed as I have been shopping for a thicker mat as I have knee problems. It is a good standard yoga mat but is not ""thick"" as described. The dimension given for the thickness is way off."
1125,__label1__,Much thicker and heavier than a regular shower liner. Can't see through it. Very good value. Only drawback it that the vinyl smell takes a few weeks to go away and a month after I put it up the folds that are there from when it comes out of the package are still there.
1126,__label1__,"The quality is okay, it looks durable too. I am satisfied with this purchase. I highly recommend it."
1127,__label1__,"I bought this for my son's bedroom. He likes it, but the picture is misleading. When you lay or sit on it, you have to keep rolling it to a shape that you feel supported. It ends up kind of flat requiring you to recline to the point you are laying down, not sitting in it as pictured. Hope that helps."
1128,__label1__,"The usage of the adapter is very straightforward: pick out the appropriate plug you need for your current location on the front of the adapter, then plug your unit into the correct jack on the back. It is a two way Adapter, allowing you to adapt in either direction. (From any country's standard to any other, for the standards supported by the unit.)"
1129,__label1__,Quality of product is good. Works fine. Do what it's supposed to do. The price is good and worth for my money.
1130,__label1__,"Great case, a little bulky. But helps to prop iPad in different positions while using and it is steady. I do use it a lot; lasting longer than other one I have no wear and tear on edges. It's good"
1131,__label1__,"No recommending to buy this product. Service is bad, unless you want a product that doesn't work and no one will help you."
1132,__label1__,"This Sand Toys Sandy Beach Big Bucket Beach/Sandbox Playset is cute and lightweight, and comes with a bunch of pieces.  It doesn't take up too much space, but has enough pieces to be a lot of fun.  All of the pieces even fit inside the bucket for transport and for storage.  We've used ours a few times and the kids have had a blast with it.  You can't beat the price and it works really well.  We are happy with it.<br /><br />The manufacturer provided ours for free for us to test and review."
1133,__label1__,"This is very good thread. needed lots of colors for a project I am doing away from home.Excellent value-6 spools of thread at a fabric store would cost more than this. If people are having a problem with breakage, maybe their tension needs to be adjusted. I sewed all day , using decorative embroidery and straight stitching and my thread never broke once. I would definitely buy again"
1134,__label1__,"This thing is worthless. Go and spend a few extra bucks on a different one...any other one. Maybe mine was just bad, but it was $$$. I can't imagine the quality being much more than what I experienced."
1135,__label1__,My headphones had such low sound quality i am not sure if they were defective or not but i did not like it
1136,__label1__,"I had very high expectations from this book but after reading it, I was a bit disappointed. Even though this book has some very important lessons to teach us, I still think there were so many things missing out in it. I really like how the author relates us humans with animals, but there could have been so much more than merely just relating the two species and giving a few examples.<br /><br />I love Natura and tend to follow it all the lessons it I learn from it. It is filled with if not millions but thousands of new ways to inspire and motivate the humans, however this book lacked that spark you expect when talking about nature. So for me, its below than what I had expected. Hence the 2 stars. Thank you"
1137,__label1__,"This hamper is really fantastic. It has a great look and was a breeze to set up. Based on the other reviews here is how I would comment, it does come with little pieces of foam all over but 10 seconds with the vacuum takes care of that."
1138,__label1__,I like the ergonomics of this pencil. At first I was dismayed with how light it is and it's a bit larger in girth than the Ohto pencil I have used for so long.
1139,__label1__,This product is very decent in look and worth it buying from amazon. I recommend every parents to buy this watch on their kids bday.
1140,__label1__,I keep this near the cat litter boxes and it works great to absorb the odors. I prefer the linen smell to the citrus.
1141,__label1__,The case was nice and provided great protection from everyday drops and other wear and tear. The only issue that there was with it was the headphone jack cut out does not fit some larger profile aux cables.
1142,__label1__,The sequel to Selection is interesting as the first part and as it goes deeper into the story you get to realize and understand some things you might didn't in the first part.
1143,__label1__,"Well written book and brings across the personal battle within a teenager well, trying to fit in with the crowd while still accepting her psychic powers. The character has been beautifully brought across. Though I do think that the book could have done without certain unnecessary events particularly towards the second half, felt the story was being dragged in certain parts. Perhaps I am being overly critical. Overall it's well written and an enjoyable read."
1144,__label1__,"Perfect pout of the box..... Had a few links taken out to size it properly. If you want a fine quality watch at a great price, this is the watch! The additional diamonds set it apart from others!"
1145,__label1__,"This carseat has great reviews in terms of how safe it is.  A look at the reports and stats involved with testing this carseat are impressive.  What they forgot in designing this carseat, however, is comfort (both for the Mom and the Baby).  My baby HATES sitting in this carseat.  It's super-narrow and deep.  Maybe the depth is what makes it so safe but I wonder if it's worth it to have your baby be uncomfortable each and every time you take a car ride. In terms of discomfort for the Mom: this car seat is heavy and bulky.  I hurt my back hauling it with a three week old so I would suggest really thinking about how much you might be moving the car seat around (I live in NYC and I take the car seat out to use in its frame as a stroller--or I used to until I decided to get rid of this monster).<br /><br />I got this car seat off of my registry and was really thankful for it but this thing is a beast!<br /><br />My husband and I recently purchased a comparatively cheap Graco carseat to use at his parents' home and my baby LOVES it.  He can flex this little legs and he slept, well, like a baby in it."
1146,__label1__,"This is probably one of the best purchases I have made recently. The quality, ease of operation, and value are excellent."
1147,__label1__,"I don't see what the fuss is about, these notebooks are great! If it's the price, I'd rather pay for it rather than run all over the place to buy from whichever seller since I don't have the time. The convenience is worth it to be honest and the notebooks are perfect for what they are used for."
1148,__label1__,"This is a great looking bookcase for a study room or living room, and fits any size book from large coffee table books to pocketsized paperbacks, in ascending order. The only problem is that because it has to lean up against the wall, you may scratch some of your wall paint off. This will differ depending on your living space."
1149,__label1__,"Disclaimer: Versatile hat for me which can be used both by female and male<br /><br />This hat is very elegant looking and also very much versatile. I gave it as a gift to my mother in law and she said that it is very helpful for her. This can be use during summer to protect the head from extreme heat and also during winter to protect from too much cold.Although it is not soft to touch, the material used to create this hat is very durable and strong as it shows and for sure won't easily be broken or damaged.I must say that this is absolutely a good value for the money for me."
1150,__label1__,"I don't want stylish (stupid) blue jeans that are worn out by stone washing at the factory. I just want regular blue jeans that fit right and wear well. That's what these Wranglers are. They are regular fit, not comfort fit, and regular style, nothing fancy, and I love them"
1151,__label1__,"I ordered this model for its price and reliability as ads. Although it doesn't get as wide of a spread as traditional fluorescent I can keep it much further away and still get effective results. The LEDs are very bright and the whole lamp seems very well put together. I've been running it 12 hours a day for the last five weeks to supplement the shorter winter days, no problems at all, highly recommend to all."
1152,__label1__,"Within 5 minutes of opening this hard drive, I was backing-up my computer! The unit allows me to do other things while it works! Any one from beginner on will have no problem using this unit. Seagate has given us another quality product! This unit will provide my storage needs for years to come!"
1153,__label1__,I washed these towels separately-alone without any other items in same wash. They came out terribly. They had fuzz balls all over them. Attempted to wash again and same thing. Will return unacceptable products.
1154,__label1__,"I know an anti-glare screen protector is of good quality if it not only removes the glare, but keeps the overall sharpness maintained. The IONIC screen protectors do just that. And they come in packs of three! Awesome deal!!"
1155,__label1__,The clear sides of the case became blue after carrying it in my jeans pocket for a few hours only. I don't know how this happened but it has never happened before. This shows clearly how bad the quality of the case is. I undermined the negative reviews and got this case anyway but they were right. Lesson learned!!
1156,__label1__,"I'd like to say I really liked these 'jumbo' dinosaurs. But they are not even jumbo at all. They aren't tiny, but by far jumbo.They are all less than 6 inches in length, and being this smaller size isn't really the big problem. What bugs me about this set, or at least the one that I received, is that there are 4 duplicate dinos. Not just the same dinosaur in a different pose, but I mean 4 exact duplicates. When I pay for 12 dinosaurs, I expect at least 12 dinosaurs in different poses, regardless if there is an occasional same dinosaur, but not 12 dinosaurs with 4 having an exact duplicate twin. The quality is not the worst I have seen before, however in many I can clearly see the mold imprint melted into the dinos. So several look like they have had an operation, and split entirely apart and melted back together. But, what do you expect from anything now days that has 'Made In China' stamped on the bottom. Overall, I'll rate these 3 stars, and lucky they get that. Would not recommend to toddlers, but only kids 5 and up, and expect them to cry when they get 4 exact duplicate dinosaurs."
1157,__label1__,"If you are a Harry Potter fan, this is a very satisfying last chapter to the story that started so long ago. This movie follows the book quite closely, with a few exceptions. The main characters are good as always, there is a lot of action, a must have if you are a fan."
1158,__label1__,Watching the presentation of this tablet. Was like watching somebody explain how to use my cell phone. It was great to know that there are other more Samsung products that just as great as 4heir phones. The deal was to great to pass up. I'm glad I got this awesome product from my good friends!!
1159,__label1__,"this is just a good enough product for me. the clothing must be thick enough for it hold as it loosens quite easily, but other than that its just fine, nothing special."
1160,__label1__,"This was a gift I got for Christmas and worked for 7 months. Not real attractive, bulky. Disappointed in the product. I'm just glad I didn't spend the money."
1161,__label1__,"This book has been instrumental in helping me with my ADD, and has even helped me to start kicking my Adderall habit. I also found a great OTC Adderall replacement to use in conjunction with the techniques in this book. You can find it on Amazon, it's called AdderRx.[[ASIN:B00G6R70J0 AdderRx (Nuphetamine HCM)- Clinically proven to increase mental focus, brain function, cognition, alertness, improve concentration, and energy for those with ADD/ADHD. Money back guarantee!]]"
1162,__label1__,"As others have said, it's very beautiful. But it was a pain to install it. It took us several trips to home depot to find the right screws for the top case."
1163,__label1__,This is not worth buying. The button is very difficult to push. If you don't rest it on something while putting on the extension its like a small exercise session.<br /><br />The best part is the Bluetooth connection which is why this is rated. I have owned it for a month and a half and only charged once.
1164,__label1__,This is a great watch but it is not water proof at all. Steam from your shower will fog up the watch to and will not clear up and shorts the batery out. As for the batery life only two years.
1165,__label1__,"Setup was fairly easy, with the menu being less intuitive than I'd prefer. Each input has image settings, so you'll need to adjust color, sharpness, brightness and contrast for each. So, far have not tried the 3D feature as glasses are $$ and up each."
1166,__label1__,"Great toys! My son was really excited to get these for his birthday and he's been banging them up and down the house ever since. I don't expect them to last until Christmas, but given the amount of punishment his given them, I'm surprised that thy managed to live this long."
1167,__label1__,"I have waited several days now and it is still 5' thick. Since the minimum thickness I wanted was 6"", I thought this mattress would be okay. But being only 5"" thick, I am unhappy with it. I would return it if I could."
1168,__label1__,"As you can tell from the title this book it is about grace. Gods Grace. What is? How to get it? How to understand it? With that comes what it can do for you, what it has done and why we want it. Max Lucado doesn't disappoint in this book. If you have read his earlier works than you know how he writes and how he sets things up. He has a particularly dry sense of humor. Some things he says makes you go Huh? Then you realize he made a joke. If you have read Lucado before you know what I am talking about. I love the way he explains things. He makes you understand through stories and never feels like he is preaching to you. Its like having a conversation with a friend.<br /><br />""God's grace--His unconditionally loving, unmerited favor--is sometimes difficult for people to grasp, even though each one of us is in desperate need of it. But in Max Lucado's new book, GRACE, it is completely embraceable and understandable.

1169,__label1__,I have tested this device with the button and works fine. I have held a cigarette directly under it for over 3 min and no alarm has sounded. Extremely worrying to think this doesn't actually work. Even with the ash tray half on fire and the alarm directly on top the alarm did not sound.
1170,__label1__,"All get great signal strength. It never drops below 45%, and is enough to maintain a 54Mbps data rate using 802.11g cards. It's all about the signal strength, and the D-Link delivers."

1172,__label1__,"I've had this battery for nearly 3 months as a replacement for my Dell E4310. I think battery life was a tad less than the OEM battery, but this was a solid product for the value. I was particularly happy that it had the battery indicator lights on the bottom, as I wasn't sure that other replacement batteries had this. At the current price I might need to pick another one up just for posterity!"
1173,__label1__,"They were shipped extremely fast. I seriously got them next day. They have Great sound, but the earphones are  to large for my ears."
1174,__label1__,"One might think that because it is educational in nature, the book would be a bore to read. I found it to be quite the opposite. I was engaged in each chapter and the information I was gaining as a result of the read."
1175,__label1__,"So, first of all, the ad shows varying colors. The colors I got varied, but THEY WEREN'T THE COLORS ON THE AD. Amazon shows these very light, pastel-like colors. I got bold greens, reds, blues, and purples.  I should know better than to purchase something so cheap, but this was ludicrous. The majority of them wouldn't “lock"" into place and the other ones take a ridiculous amount of strength to set. After doing some research, I found an even cheaper (and better quality) brand. Give Clover a shot and don't waste your time with these."
1176,__label1__,the set comes with every piece needed for the majority of home repairs.  Unless you're doing a larger job you may need an alternative set but for all around home-based jobs this set is not only great but long lasting and durable materials.
1177,__label1__,"I was so hoping I had found a good moisture cream for everyday and under my make-up but when you first put it on it almost feels like your face begins to perspire and you have to wait awhile to let it absorb, weird! Unfortunately it doesn't feel any better than the inexpensive day creams I've bought in the past. I won't be using very often."
1178,__label1__,I used these glasses for walking and softball. They were very comfortable and fit well even when running to the bases. I noticed that there were no smudges on the lens even after sweating and from the sunscreen.
1179,__label1__,I had cheap doorknobs before and someone broke into my apartment. Now I have this thing and I already feel safer. I can't figure out why I didn't just go with this when I moved though. My last place had pretty sturdy locks.
1180,__label1__,"This is a good cable to have, it’s long enough for me to carry my tablet around while it’s plugged in but not too long to get tangled up with other wires in the office or to get tripped on. it’s very convenient as it allows ease of movement and it’s durable."
1181,__label1__,Fake reviews. this product taste like crap and is so expensive. But I give it 2 stars because you said its healthy LOL
1182,__label1__,I would not purchase this rug again. The color is way off; it says Gold but is a light cream color. The rug is thin and will not lie flat because the &#34;shag&#34; is to thin and not heavy enough to lay flat so the creases in it remain from where it was rolled up. You can see the backing becausethere is not enough weave in the rug.
1183,__label1__,Great Product! I like the ergonomic aspects of this lil guy. If you have bone issues you will appreciate this design
1184,__label1__,"I know that this thing has lots of calories and  adds a lot of extra pounds to my body, but I just cannot stop from eating it. IT's very tasteful and...I don't know to say...it gives me a very rewarding feeling.<br />Unfortunately, it has to suffer during shipment: at some of my orders, the lid was already shredded."
1185,__label1__,"So, after getting what says to be Food Grade diatomaceous earth, I found that it has way too much clay in it. Clay can do some major damage if you are not careful. Also, Food grade isn't this dirty. I don't think I can let my dogs or Kitties even get near this."
1186,__label1__,"This TV displays some great pictures, so I have no complaints. I really don't care about much of anything that it offers really. As long as I can watch great shows with great quality, I'll be fine."
1187,__label1__,"Yeah, it does not reach the edge...I knew that before buyin it, I mean look at the price...that's pretty good...<br /><br />Installation was pretty easy.<br /><br />Just the protection was a bit lacking from a drop, I guess I had some bad stroke of luck...and something hit the non protected curve..."
1188,__label1__,The wireless connection of these speakers works pretty well but the sound quality is the big disappointment. Very tinny sound with lack of base. If I crank up the volume the plastic enclosure starts vibrating causing discoloration of the sound. I am now using regular bookshelf speakers instead.

But he had strong supporting characters that were fun to follow."

1196,__label1__,"Got this for my birthday and overall sound quality id rate it about average.  It does a bit better than my 50"" lg that its hooked up to, but nothing earth shattering.<br /><br />Took a bit of playing around with the settings to get the sound right, and the sub provides a good bass if you turn it up.  If space is tight I would recommend this setup, but otherwise I would go for a better surround sound package."
1197,__label1__,"I started out by buying one set in a queen size and when I put it on the bed, it fell short, literally. It's really sized better for a full size bed. But I liked it as a throw for my full sized down comforter so I kept it. Next I bought the king size and it's really a queen size."

1202,__label1__,I use this with my phone and Pandora and it works great (radio quality if not better sound) - the only complaint I have is it does not turn of with the car (it stays lit up etc).<br /><br /> Im not sure if that drains too much battery life so I try unplugging it if I remember to do so each time.  Overall worth the money and works as advertised.

1209,__label1__,The quality is very poor. It's sturdy and comfortable but the sound is horrible.

1213,__label1__,What I really like about this product is that it is very durable and it's not that heavy. I also like the fit in my hand it's just right. I use it at night when I get hungry and it works great. I've had it for 6 months and still works like brand new.
1214,__label1__,Damn this think is strong! I have never seen something so powerful before. I was hesitant to press &#34;place order&#34; on amazon but its a good thing that I went ahead and did that otherwise I would have spent millions on a brand new one.

1225,__label1__,I love my new bag. Carried it on a cruise and it was big enough to hold everything I needed for 7 days but not so big it was hard to handle.

When that made the news, his male friend panicked and passed him to another male friend and then on to another until all of them were panicked thinking they were going to get blamed for his murder or abduction. Eventually the poor boy makes it home to his parents, but not until after aother failed suicide attempt. It doesn't end well either. It's a good read, but not for fun."
1234,__label1__,This is a fun car for my six year old and occasionally my twelve year old hops on. They both get comments how cute they look riding down the sidewalk. It even has a real radio. I think the price is worth it for the enjoyment factor.
1235,__label1__,Easy to put together and looks great when completed. The screws used to attach the backing has a raised round head which does not sink in all the way so if it sits against the wall it will scratch or damage wall. The bottom of legs need some sort of floor protector as it's unfinished and will scratch floor. Great price and very sturdy.

1248,__label1__,These Almonds is a healthy snack and a very reasonably priced. Just adequate amount of salt. Super happy with the purchase and will order more.
1249,__label1__,"After looking high and low for a nice looking but plain belt, I was happy to find this here and purchased it. It's a very good looking leather belt and it is nice enough to wear with a suit or casual enough to wear with jeans....very versatile.... love it."
1250,__label1__,I spent hours trying to make this work. It has almost no moving parts and should be a a lot simpler than this BUT nothing worked. I saw it actually work for 30 secs before it stopped working. Very disappointed in it as the reviews from otters were great. Documentation is awful. Try another pool cleaner and skip this one.
1251,__label1__,I would suggest that every woman own one of these! It is a great item to have so that you get a great fit in all your clothing. Especially great for bra fitting and tracking weight loss!

If she gets the other deck, Pot Odds, I'll probably see if it will help my game."
1253,__label1__,"This is one great mattress. The only problem is that there is an odor emitting from the mattress. It has been over 2 weeks and it still smells. If there was no smell, it would be a 5 star rating. Do not know if this is normal or not. Will call if the odor continues."
1254,__label1__,Bought this for my four year old son the belly world not inflate so i took it back and got another one still a piece of junk that don't work. The second ones belt was even broke. Going to take this one back also and try for a third time because my son wants it so bad but if he didn't know about it I would not buy another one!!!
1255,__label1__,My husband used this product when he traveled alone with my son from AL to AZ. It was great for him to just roll the seat while holding my son's hand. There was also room inside to put the diaper bag so his arms and shoulders were free too! It also held the largest car seat I know of - the Graco Nautilus - see my review on this awesome car seat!
1256,__label1__,Do you want to know my favorite feature of this inflatable? It's how fast this thing sets up! It's amazing. Get it started and within one minute it's fully blown up and the kids are ready to start bouncing!

1258,__label1__,"This is the real deal. There are a lot of stock and base flavorings to choose from, but I have not found any that can compare to this brand. Whether you are making a stir fry, soup or stew, or you simply want additional flavor in your gravy you will really enjoy the authentic roasted flavor of this product."
1259,__label1__,I hated these Oreos. They sucked. They were just sucky Oreos. One of them fell in the milk and now I'm bitter. They were actually really good. Sorry for wasting your time
1260,__label1__,"I had considered the purchase of a ""Battery Tender"" brand maintainer for quite some time. I found this unit at my local store, and read the previous reviews after returning home. At roughly half the price, I decided to give it a try, and haven't regretted it."
1261,__label1__,A definite negative for the standard Space Pen. By adding the clip you really make the pen more useful and less prone to being misplaced.
1262,__label1__,"I originally had this calculator starting in 5th grade. I used the same one until my 11th grade year when I then had to switch to a TI graphing calculator. I gave the it to my younger sister, who used it for 2 yrs. more until it finally bit the dust!"
1263,__label1__,"This was my first touchscreen phone; I got it because it was a good price, but I really regret buying it. At first it was okay, but I've had it for about 9 months now, and I get extremely frustrated with it.<br /><br />The lag is HORRIBLE. If I try to call someone, it usually takes anywhere from 30 seconds to 3-4 minutes to actually place the call. It gets really frustrating. I'll press the call button and wait a few minutes before it actually calls. A lot of the time I'll receive a call from the person while I'm trying to call them because they're tired of waiting for the call to go through. Then I'm dialing them and they're calling me at the same time, and hanging up ends both the calls and we have to start over. It's pretty ridiculous.<br /><br />The apps freeze and crash a lot - and not just downloaded apps, ALL of the apps on the phone. If I go to my contacts and try to call someone, the app freezes and says it has to close and I have to reopen it. This happens a lot with messaging, too. I'll try to click on a message and the app freezes and force closes. Also, there's a weird glitch where I open a message and try to type, and it won't let me. I have to tap on the message box over and over again, sometimes for a couple of minutes, before it finally lets me type. If I type a word, it shows that I'm trying to type it and then deletes each letter as I type it.<br /><br />The memory is pretty bad. I was going to just get an SD card and use it to store apps and stuff so I could have more on the phone, but most of the apps won't even go on the SD card and have to be stored on the phone, so there's really no point. I have barely anything on my phone (maybe 5 apps and 150-200 pictures), and the memory is full.<br /><br />Another weird glitch I've been having is when I press the unlock button, nothing happens, and I have to press it about ten times before it actually responds and lets me unlock the phone.<br /><br />Overall a really crappy phone - I do NOT recommend getting it. It looks good at first, but the lag and horrible memory make it a very bad choice. If I had the money to get a new one, I would in a heartbeat so I wouldn't have to deal with this piece of crap anymore. I want to throw it at a wall every time I try to use it."
1264,__label1__,"Bought this for my motherinlaw. She loved it! It's light, compact and appears very versatile. Just wish they had a different color other than blue. But I guess that makes it kind of fun. Appears maybe it is washable too! Well worth it!"
1265,__label1__,I got a 2 oz version of this instead of the 4 oz. I feel like I was ripped off. But just be careful because the size is not listed on the product page.
1266,__label1__,I purchased to replace my previous compressor which was dog slow. This one works fairly quick but does best when your engine is running. I find that especially irritating if I am checking all four tires. A big waste of gasoline. Still I'm satisfied with the product. A very good portable compressor. I like the way the connections are made which are of excellent quality. The price is reasonable
1267,__label1__,"I've had expensive luggage ruined by airline mistreatment in 1 trip. This made 1st trip just fine, & with normal handling looks like it will last quite a few more. Easy to transport also."

It is so beautiful made, all the precious stones placed in such a way as to look like a natural waterfall of colors. I get at least 5 comments of praise whenever I wear it."
1269,__label1__,"Alright, this is a review that is based on my first week of experience. Everything is pre-installed, you don't have to do anything except connect to your screen and power supply. Of course, there are optional applications that came with a disc. Activation code is labeled on the computer. Everything works out fine. All the driver updates and applications that are necessary for your hard drive took about 10% of storage, something that I found some people do complain about. But nothing useless is found, unlike majority of pc on the market. Now as for gaming. It does allow you to run majority of games that are available. However, keep that in mind, lots of games have low requirements, so this hardware works just fine. I use mmohut as reference, but a lot game review sites have similar rating on games. For their top rate games, this computer is nothing to brag about. Many popular games have way too high requirement that is just out of this computer's league. It does allow me to play certain game like Soul of Ultimate Nation at high setting very smooth. For a casual gamer, less intensive applications, and for $500, this computer is truly a steal. But if you want to run heavy intensive games like WoW, Terra, and so on; you can settle for low setting or do some serious upgrades. My new parts are arriving soon, so I will update as soon as I can.<br /><br />Update: I bought AMD Radeon HD 7850 ($210) to replace the graphic card that came with the machine. Now this is truly a gaming computer. Everything is above 7.0 in Windows Index except hard drive. The new graphic card makes the machine runs extremely quiet, unlike before which felt a trunk driving by every single time it is turned on. Although I did upgrade the memory ram to 16GB, which I don't think it's really necessary for everyone. My advice to everyone that want to play some of the popular game today, upgrade to a better graphic card. Another thing I notice is that my computer's motherboard is GA-78LMT-S2, while current product description is ASRock 960GM-GS3 FX. They probably changed to the newer one.<br /><br />My rating still remains. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I do want to run the games I like in medium to high settings smoothly. This is also my first time to purchase a built PC and have upgrade it myself. I'm ok with what it is, and can be upgraded quite easily."
1270,__label1__,This was a waste of cash. I did not get my results or feel like I was better. I read that a lot of people felt that their joints were better. Not so with me. I feel that I was actually worse off.
1271,__label1__,The product looks more trendy in the pic<br />But in real it's just a bit of cloth made into a wallet with a hint of leather on it.
1272,__label1__,This product not so good working. I am not happy with this product.It is waste of money. I don't want to use it again.
1273,__label1__,"Good price looks ok except for the green parts. But my phone never stuck properly, even after cleaning both surfaces. And it never stayed stuck to my windshield. Longest of several trials was 16 minutes. I returned it after a few days."
1274,__label1__,I saw this a Ross and bought one for my 4 months old son since he started flipping around the bed. It not as think as I was hoping but enough cushion to prevent him from getting hurt on the laminated floor.
1275,__label1__,It's pretty good! It's comfortable on the head and I don't really have to strain my eyes to see in the dark.
1276,__label1__,"This is a really great addition to my kitchen arsenals, it can be used for peeling vegetables, washing rice and it can also be used to strain fruits and grains, plus a lot more! It just works effectively and nicely, but what I really like more about it is its ability to be flexed. It's so soft and can be used as a squeezer too! I just like this purchase and will recommend it to my friends. And by the way it's portable! Can be a perfect bowl for picnics!"
1277,__label1__,Cheap solution to stacks of magazines laying around. They are not going to last forever as the plastic is a little flimsy but it does the job.
1278,__label1__,This is actually a good deal and perfect for someone like me who still can't get over computer games even in my age. I probably won't be able to play it as much though.
1279,__label1__,"My son, age 2.75 yrs has not learned to use the brake yet. He adores this bike and rides it at any opportunity. It is great that the glide bar can be rotated 90 degrees out of the way of the feet with a simple button and whole mechanism."
1280,__label1__,"Good chic lit book that's surprisingly well-crafted.  Enough of what you expect to be satisfying, enough surprises to make you keep reading.  Excellent beach/vacation/mind escape book."
1281,__label1__,We have had this almost 3 weeks and the SMELL is still so overwhelming it almost makes us sick. For now we are sleeping in another room. Will the smell ever go away!? Anyone else with this problem?
1282,__label1__,"I don't know what to think about this book. In one respect I want to say trash, because without using Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre as a basis for this book it probably wouldn't have sold even one copy. One the other hand I love Jane Eyre and I did kinda enjoy this book. Not well enough to recommend it to friends, but well enough to give it a couple stars."
1283,__label1__,"YOu can see easily through the pen how much ink there is left. (the picture of the pens does not really show that so clearly, but I like this feature because then you know when you need refills!)<br /><br />The quality of these pens is excellent!"
1284,__label1__,This is one of the worst and cheapest tools that did absolutely nothing. I immediately returned it because it was inoperable. It looks nothing like it did in the picture. Not worth the money.
1285,__label1__,"This is a good Jasmine tea. Not great but good.  Its light as green teas tend to be but the jasmine gives it a soothing aroma and interesting taste.  The only thing is that it does have an odd taste I can't put my finger on. Not that it's bad, it's not at all, just leaves you wondering, ""What is that flavor?"" It's interesting to say the least.  Otherwise, this is an extremely relaxing tea as most Jasmines tend to be.<br /><br />I would have preferred a smaller size to start with but this was the only option, at least on amazon.  I also ordered a higher grade version of jasmine at the same time; [[ASIN:B00HFMON0Y Organic Jasmine Pearls Loose Leaf Green Tea 4 oz. + FREE Blueberry Pomegranate White Tea 2 oz]]  Hhmm, that free blueberry pom was not offered to me in my last order.  Anyway, I steeped this tea for 5 minutes and was just amazed by its fragrance.  I love the amazing floral note from this jasmine, no foreign taste in this one that I cannot put my finger on.  If you can afford it, always go with high grade leaves."
1286,__label1__,"I own this style in a more expensive pair. This one is good for the price. If the expensive ones were next to these, you could tell the difference, but on their own, in your ears, I think you'd get many compliments. They can be worn for evening or, with the present trends, you could wear them with jeans.,"
1287,__label1__,This is an unfortunate product. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who needs something more durable. This is good for light work at best.
1288,__label1__,Software installation is not ideal: installs different software components in sequential parts but requests a computer reboot after each part; if you reboot after the first part then the rest of the software is not installed.
1289,__label1__,I bought this as a gift for my daughter's birthday. She loved it. It's much prettier in person. The only problem was that the locking feature was defective. One side of the locking mechanism was missing. I am returning it but requesting a duplicate be shipped to me. It is very beautiful.
1290,__label1__,We always keep a box of this in the cupboard for when we have people at our house. It's got a nice coffee flavor without being too bold. It is a nice middle-of-the-road coffee for people that drink coffee a lot and those that don;t drink much at all.
1291,__label1__,"There wasn't anything special about this item. The fit was OK, the raider patch could have been adjusted to sit a little lower overall just OK"
1292,__label1__,"I agree with the other reviewer these clickers are not very loud at all and I have trouble hearing it outsdide especially with cars going down my street. I have had some luck with it though, and for the price you get 3 so it's a good deal. Just wish they were louder."
1293,__label1__,Been searching around for a decent crib set that isn't over price and came upon this. Love it! I think the bumper is just perfect for what I'm looking for. I didn't want those big bulky bumper this one is perfect!
1294,__label1__,I purchased one for my classroom to play music for my students. They enjoyed the speaker so much that I ended up purchasing more to raffle off for good behavior and good grades.
1295,__label1__,"I have previously owned 5 toothbrushes but this one without a doubt was the worst. It was more noisy (with a wavering, disconcerting sound) and it was very inconsistent in recharging -- sometimes it completed in 8 to twelve hours; other times it was still charging after 24 hours. Then my wife took the fully charged unit on a trip, and it was fully discharged after one day's usage. It was only a year and a half old..."
1296,__label1__,"I didn't think it was fair to give a low number of stars because this book was not for me. But this book was not for me.<br /><br />I listened to the audio sample, and the guy sounded just like my history teacher in my school.<br /><br />I was hoping to find a book to make history exciting, for me. Instead I found someone who is boring, just like my teacher. Maybe he makes good points, or different points than my teacher.<br /><br />But he's still boring. I hope this is not unfair. I'm sure it's a great book if you like boring things. I don't."
1297,__label1__,Item as decribed.Wonderful Handbag! I love it so much. Beautiful color. It fits for many of my dresses. Fast shipping too
1298,__label1__,YoYoInk has made a great quality ink cartridge. I am pleased with the print quality I have received. I have been using these cartridges for 6 months with no issues.
1299,__label1__,Gave this to my mother one time and she baked every single pie recipe in it when we came over for a visit. It was great but I think she'll be sending us a lot of pies over the next years because of this.
1300,__label1__,"Saw this doll house in a store, Grand-daughter loved it right away. We had trouble getting her out the door of the toy store, so I would say it already has good reviews before she even opens the box!"
1301,__label1__,I love this show honestly the best thing in TV right now! But when I bought the DVD I don't know if it was because its an older season but the quality wasn't the best. I wish I would have gotten the Blue-ray. I'm someone that appreciates the quality of film I'm watching  as well. It was a bit distracting but others may not be that critical. I rather get my other Modern Family DVD's in Blue-ray.
1302,__label1__,"It functions well, but is what it is; an inexpensive record player. Don't expect high-quality stereo sound; it sounds like a portable record player. It is what I had expected when ordering and am satisfied with the purchase."
1303,__label1__,"I find it to be as good as the main brand, the one everyone seems to look up to, and that cost more as well. We like this product very much and we decided to buy enough to last us until 2014, knowing that this product does age well, especially when sealed."
1304,__label1__,This works perfectly. I like not having to fight with the thermometer under his arm. It was easy changing the measurement to Celsius. The temperature is very quick and seems accurate. Very happy with it.
1305,__label1__,"This is quite an eye opener. Liz was this kind of lady, was she? I heard rumors, but wow. If this isn’t true though, then this is one slanderous piece."
1306,__label1__,i would not want to be the detectives who explain how this happened. i think the morning briefing in some of these investigating authorities would have been unpleasant. i think more than one person would have said so that just happened.
1307,__label1__,"This is partly my fault since I printed the pictures off of an inkjet printer, but should the ink really just slider off like this? It's like splashing a perfect image on to the paper with paint. You don't expect it to stay as it is."
1308,__label1__,"The umbrella functions well and it does provide the shade I was looking for. I didn't like the stand as it was intrusive and would require an individual to walk around and avoid it. I bolted it into our cement patio. Had that not been done, an umbrella that sits in the center would have sufficed."
1309,__label1__,"I was horrified to see the recipes are pretty basic (designed for kindergarten kids) and doesn't' even have 1 picture. For example, the author Michael Matthews tells me how to make PEANUT BUTTER AND OATMEAL, do I really need to be taught how to mix peanut butter and oatmeal in a bowl? Put it in a microwave and eat it for breakfast? Unless I'm missing a brain cell, I think it's appalling to call this simple breakfast a recipe!! And very unhealthy to suggest I use a microwave to cook most of the meals!! Also there's lots of typing errors all over the place, as if it's been hastily copied and pasted. I had expected a lot more after reading all the positive reviews but I'm very disappointed, it seems you can't always trust what you see, if it looks too good to be true most of the time it isn't true. This is an okay book with average recipes nothing more than 1 or 2 stars."
1310,__label1__,"If you are looking for basic theft deterrance this is a great camera. It is easy enough to set up. This is not a really high end machine, and it is about as good as the price range it is in."

1313,__label1__,"I wanted this for my girls' bedroom, but it failed to glow as brightly as it should have. There was a slight shimmer, but that's pretty much it. So disappointed with this product."
1314,__label1__,"These bluetooth headphones really made my day.When i first saw them,i definitely decided to try it on and test them out.The sound quality is just sooooooo awesome and so clear.I can hear anything when wearing these headphones! The bluetooth function is great and I haven't had a problem with it at all.Easy to understand guides and a high quality headphones which can be a great gift for anyone.I also tried these headphones on my Iphone and the sound quality was great there as well.Steady bluetooth connection and a great look.Definitely one of the best headphones I've ever had!There was a slight problem with charging but i hope it's fixed now.  ***UPDATE*** So after enjoying the sound quality for a couple of weeks I decided to take it on a trip... I packed it in the case it came with and after coming back home and unfolding the headsets the headpiece on the left just detached itself... Turns out this product is really flimsy so to be honest I'd recommend spending your money elsewhere... Seller tried to help but it was just a cold response with no viable solution. It was fun but it was short lived. Here are the pictures to determine what happened only after UNFOLDING this... Pathetic material"
1315,__label1__,"Kim Sheridan has taken some time off from her school teaching job in a poor part of London to help her cousin out at the hotel she and her husband run, because her husband is in hospital. On the way she gets in a fender bender with non other than her ex-husband, Luke Savage, who, by coincidence, is staying at the hotel. They lapse into argument, because these are two people who truly seem to dislike each other. In fact, if two people never should have been married, well these are them.<br /><br />At the hotel, Kim discovers Luke is a writer, you think she would have known this, and that he is hiding out here to work. Then Kim's cousin is required at the hospital to be at her husband's bedside for a few days and now Kim is running the hotel by herself. She doesn't anticipate any problem, after all, there aren't too many guests. Then two of the staff come down with food poisoning and now she's in trouble. Then the ex she can't stand offers to pitch in and help and for a few pages there we think maybe he's not such a bad guy. Then more guests, friends of Luke's, show up and the books really takes off.<br /><br />I'll admit that at first I didn't think I was going to like this book. Luke is one of those self-assured, kiss 'em and they swoon kind of men that some romance writers like to write about, but that I don't like to read about, but he has character and lots of good qualities and that pulled the book up a lot in my estimation. A very nice and enjoyable read."
1316,__label1__,"Recently my One of  friend told me about this product, then I order this product here from amazon.But when I got this product I am little-bit disappoint the design the not so good.The designer take a look about this  thing I hope.<br /><br />But the colour really good.I like this colour."
1317,__label1__,I love this hamper. It's a very nice hamper for a nursery. It is on the small side and it is a bit dainty. I have one in each teenager's room and after 3 days the hamper is filled. They bottom is small and the top is wide.
1318,__label1__,We put this in our RV to replace the hide-a-bed couch that takes up to much room (when used as a bed). How well it actually works will be up to our 12 year old granddaughter. Since she can sleep most anywhere the next revue should be good.
1319,__label1__,"This universal CD slot magnetic phone holder works great, minus the fact the grease from using the phone and the suction cup does not cling to it very long."
1320,__label1__,"The bean bags arrived on time so that was good. Everything else was downhill! The bags had a terrible smell to them when they arrived. Not sure if that if that is amazon's fault or the company that made them, but I wasn't happy."
1321,__label1__,"Compared to the other labels from other printers, this one is cheaper on per-label. So far, we haven't had any label mis-feed or labels getting caught in the printer. That is over 3 years of usage in a busy medical office, going through about 2-3 boxes of labels per month."
1322,__label1__,"This rug was ordered for a nursery, and it feels great underfoot, either with shoes or barefooted. I was happy to see the color and plushness lived up to the picture and description, and that the workmanship is finished on all edges and the underside. I would recommend this product and would purchase again."
1323,__label1__,"This is some excellent cappuccino right here, made all the more surprising because it's instant cappuccino."
1324,__label1__,I am streaming from my iPhone 6. I can only get 10 feet range. If I move the phone further away from the speakers the signal will drop out every few seconds.
1325,__label1__,It is good music stand for my music sheet and it has very light weight to move around which is really nice. But can't put small music sheet on top of it because of that empty space. It falls off back and stand hold bottom seems weak. I think it could be easily break but so far good.
1326,__label1__,"This mattress is not comfortable at all. We got it for our kids room and they started complaining about back issues a few weeks after we got it. Once we slept on it, we realized it is complete crap!"
1327,__label1__,"Honestly I had high hoped for this product but it disappointed me. I got it from the Supercuts promo for free, and my barber said it would work on my thinning hair. Well it did actually work, but it took over 6 months for me to see results! You're better off chopping off all your hair, unless you have a ton of patience. Also a negative is how high the price is for this product. At the mall they're selling it for over $70 PER BOTTLE. This is just far too high. The sales lady was nice enough, very attractive and convincing in trying to buy it but I'm not going to give up $70 just because she smiles at me. Anyway, that's my 2 cents."
1328,__label1__,Chainsaw worked like a chainsaw. It cut logs stalled out needed gas just as all chainsaws do. Refurbished or not I am extremely satisfied with this product. Consider taking another look
1329,__label1__,This baby bather is perfect for kitchen sinks and bath tubs. It's light weight folds down and allows the water to run rite through it and not let it settle in the bottom like regular tubs do.

1332,__label1__,"I have kids at home, so getting rid of unwanted fleas is a must. I bought this in the hope of a more healthy way (without using chemical) of getting rid of those pests. However, it only caught a few fleas so far....not really satisfied."
1333,__label1__,"For aspiring writers, the Poetic Edda is a must-read and a must-own. You simply can't pursue your<br />dreams of creating excellent literature without first drinking from the deep well of inspiration<br />that comes with this collection of poetic beauty. This version is quite close in terms of accuracy of<br />translation as well, so it's highly recommended."
1334,__label1__,You have brought back a flood of memories with this dip mix!! I love it and everyone in my family and anyone else who has tasted it loves it! Why have the stores in Richmond VA pulled it from the shelves? I will buy this by the case if I could find it again!
1335,__label1__,My car looks good now. However I am not quite sure of the durability of these sticker. But still looking good since I purchased it from last week.
1336,__label1__,"This really sucks. Period.<br />I’m not having it, at first RAW video was working with the KB 64g card. Then I recorded a few amazing segments using h.264 and received an error2, then card not readable. My work clips are gone!!. what am I supposed to do?<br />I trusted a bunch of BS reviews. Pinching pennies failed my work is gone. Back to the drawing board reality’s set in. I’m not second guessing the cost of SanDisk 160mb/s and reliable Hoodmans ever again."
1337,__label1__,"This product is exceptional, this is my second unit. I live in country and just outside an area code border. We only can get 4mb per second service internet and this works great. Only time I have experienced some breakup is if all 5 of us are on the net at once."

1339,__label1__,as a diabetic I have to be really careful what I put into my drinks etc but I have been hearing a lot about macha and I was curious if it was ok for diabietis. I bought this book because it let me pay what I want but I was expecting low quality because of that. It is actually a really nice book. I dont really see specific information for diabetics bu t I do see that its very natural and the benefits are impressive so ill probably purchase some. i will ask my doctor before taking to be sure.
1340,__label1__,"The chaise is very nice, It was easy to assemble and looks good in my room, The chaise is on the smaller side and not heavy. so be aware of that when choosing. If you are looking for an accent piece that will not have heavy use.this chaise is lovely,"
1341,__label1__,"Got these for house party and well, they rocked too. They look so beautiful and they got everyone awed. This LED flower pot is made from the plastic. Different colors shine through the plastic and its just so pretty and creative."
1342,__label1__,"I am very disappointed to see the direction they has gone. I see the new label states that it's ""dermatologist tested."" Perhaps it should be tested on dermatologists instead of animals. I shall be returning my unopened bottle."
1343,__label1__,This is nice although the Serene stylus pen has the smallest nib tip around for writing and detailed work on your screen. It comes with a soft silicone grip. View it at serenestylus.com

1345,__label1__,"I originally got this in a variety pack. This was, by far, my favorite! I love too! If you like a higher fruit to nut ratio then this one is for you! Cherry berry is yummy as well, and I go for that when I want more nuts."

1347,__label1__,"I had high hopes for this stapler...<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's a piece of junk. It didn't bind the paper well enough. I found the documents loose after using it.<br /><br />After testing it out for 30 minutes, the spring broke. Now, the device is totally useless.<br /><br />This is complete junk."
1348,__label1__,"Decent, at best. This trimmer is WAY too loud (over three times my old corded one that I'm trying to replace) and the attachments are cheap. The &#34;dock&#34; requires you plug the trimmer in and then set it down, and the base unit doesn't hardly hold any of the peripherals to the trimmer."
1349,__label1__,I orignally bought this table a few years ago to use as a nightstand in my bedroom. It looks great and the price was good. I decided to buy another one a year ago but I was told that it had discontinued this item.
1350,__label1__,"Very light and comfortable---as other reviewers said, they are big, and not the best-looking sunglasses, but they work great for running etc, and I can't see myself in a mirror while I'm running, so who cares how I look? For the cost, I am pleased with the purchase."
1351,__label1__,These are great little snacks. I love having these when I'm in the mood for something sweet. They aren't too big either so they can easily be carried in a purse or pocket. They are the best for snacking or making caramel apples!
1352,__label1__,I ordered the product and I was not pleased with the quality so I returned it. The leader was dull and hard and scratched easily. Others seem to like and maybe I'm simply too picky but this product did not meet my expectations.
1353,__label1__,"This was a wonderful buy for me. As a new college student, I wanted something cheap (but not cheaply made), cute, and useful"
1354,__label1__,"It worked great for a day.... I used it to pump up kids bikes and it worked great, but when I tried to pump up my small trailer tire 50 psi and it stopped working. At first I thought it overheated so I left it overnight and tried again the next day and it did not work.. O well.. they returned it with no problem at the store."
1355,__label1__,"When I bought the black leggings I thought they were okay, they didn't fit as comfortably as I would of wanted. But since I paid premium for these leggings, I thought I would give it a shot. So I went to the Gym in them and every single guy and girl kept telling me that these the portion in the back were way too transparent and were able to see through. I have to admit that I do not like to wear underwear when I use leggings, so you can imagine what was the reaction.<br /><br />I felt so embarrassed, these leggings are are revealing in the back, since I couldn't tell from the front much. I will have to trow these leggings to the trash, not work everyone making funny faces at me."
1356,__label1__,"I have to say that I am trying to loose weight and following all kind of diets, but these miniatures are irresistible. I eat at least one bag per week (most of time: 2-3 bags).

1359,__label1__,I got this tablet for my kids to have something to play with and I must say it is very handy. It can pretty much do what a laptop can do but much more portable. The kids just love playing apps on it and watching youtube videos. Definitely a great tablet in my opinion.
1360,__label1__,"Not a good product, buyer beware... bought item and was disappointed to find that it was delivered with little or no ink, don't waste your money."
1361,__label1__,I thought the movie unfolded beautifully in a not such a beautiful reality it depicts. I especially liked Demi Moor and think she did a pretty good job playing Lola's Mom. The parallel drawn between 4 generations of women is apparent and fun to watch.
1362,__label1__,Just got it. Worked for 5 minutes then the mouse cursor started to freeze every 5 seconds. I found this mouse defective so I tried to contact and shared my problem to the costumer service and gladly they respond quickly .
1363,__label1__,"This speaker seemed really cool at first because the light is a nice feature.  It didn't sound any better than the speakers in my HTC One, but the light made it a fun desk toy.  The problem is that it only worked for a week prior to breaking.  The manufacturer won't honor their warranty, saying that the retailer I bought it from wasn't &#34;authorized&#34; by them to sell it in their store."
1364,__label1__,"The photo reprints come out great, very simple to use. Easy setup. I was looking for an Envy Printer that would be easy to use and be an ink saver but fortunately ink saver DID NOT meet my expectations. Everything else works like a charm but I was very disappointed with ink usage, it eats ink like crazy in my opinion."
1365,__label1__,I had high hopes for this chair and planned on buying a dozen for our office. Unfortunately it was not very comfortable to sit in and has no lower back support. It also does not raise high enough for shorter people to sit at a desk properly.
1366,__label1__,"Nice mattress for the money, a little firmer than was expecting but other than that no complaints. Overall I am quite satisfied. Good price."
1367,__label1__,It was very easy to assemble. It is made of quality materials and sturdy. It works well. Having the handle bar is great because it's easier to read the meter. It doesn't take up much space. I'm glad I bought it.
1368,__label1__,"Lead contamination of matcha is a real problem in China! I understand that lead has been entering the River Yangtze and East China Sea as a result of poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China (Huh and Chen 1999). Water irrigations systems for farms obtain water from the River Yangtze! As a result the tea plants do get contaminated with lead. Even organic farms in China are at risk. In 2006 Han et al showed that 32% of 1225 tea samples from China contained lead at levels that exceed the maximum permissible concentration. In 2013 Consumer Lab dot com advised people not to consume matcha from China until you are sure about the purity of the matcha! The only way to be sure about the purity of the matcha is to see a lab report on the amount of lead in the matcha. Lead can damage any organ in the body including the brain, causing learning and behavioural problems and also problems with doing arithmetic or language problems.<br />I think it is important that a lab report on lead content of the matcha is uploaded on to Amazon by one organic as it is a matter of food safety. Until then I will not drink this matcha which clearly says on the back of the pack that it is a ""Product of China”. It is an important issue. Once I have seen the lab report on Amazon I will write what I thought about the appearance and taste of this matcha.<br /><br />It is useful to read ""SCALE AND CAUSES OF LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE TEA” and the Consumer Lab dot com article which you can find online. They are a real eye-opener!"
1369,__label1__,"I bought it as a gift for my good friend. I heard great things about Summer Infant Organic Cotton blanket. I figured this would make a perfect baby shower gift. Sorry, can't help much with describing how well this works since it's not for me."
1370,__label1__,The power and volume buttons make it very hard to press. Also there seems to be some sharp seams along the edges. Had to return it.
1371,__label1__,"After searching on-line, and in local retail sporting goods stores, the BEST price available was on the web site. The product quality and performance rival much more expensive products. They work as advertised when shooting at the range, and are also great when working with noisy power tools, lawn mower, and lawn tractor."
1372,__label1__,wasn't everything that I was thinking it would be.  I had a hard time making it work for my application.  it was made out of good materials and arrived fast but it was not what I was after
1373,__label1__,My wife and I like the fact it is organic and has no fillers. We use it in our coffee and love it. Also great health benefits from stevia from what I have read.
1374,__label1__,Three of them were not working when I got them. They are just flat and obviously look like fake candles.
1375,__label1__,Great book but the spine fell apart. I only paid a couple of bucks for it so I didn't send it back. The seller should check the quality before sending to the customer.
1376,__label1__,"Overall, I think this is a cool product.  I had a lot of fun using it but it was bulky and hard to hold.  Maybe I have tiny hands.  My son wanted to use this so I let him try.  He's 11 and he really wasn't able to do much with it since he had to hold it with two hands but he had fun trying which is what is most important.  I wish this was rechargable so there wasn't a cord.  I did make some fun little things and after about 20 minutes I got the hang of it and it made it easier.  I will be buying more plastic for it because I do like it a lot and think that with some practice I will be able to make some pretty cool things.  There are just some design issues I wish could be addressed which is why I gave it three stars."
1377,__label1__,This seems cruel but with the scare of dengue I had to do something. No chemicals that can harm me or my pet. Scares me every time it zaps but works well. The only thing is that the plug is weird and the gadget needs to be supported while charging. Charge last a long time and the fact that is re-chargeable is way better that batteries.
1378,__label1__,"This brought back so many great memories as a kid. I had to have it. Showed up on time, and does everything it list. Awesome for around the tree. yes u should buy 1 for the family. THANKS amazon!"
1379,__label1__,The hand shower worked well for only three months before a massive leakage took place right under the adapter of the hose. It was not at the connective part between the handle and hose but part of the hose. Note the shower handle was kept on the holder for most of the time in use.
1380,__label1__,I do not like this product at all. Cheap plastic abd doesn't fit well either. I would look else where.
1381,__label1__,"I found it to be very user friendly, i just hate the fact that the very next day i ordered then they went on sale for half the price....that was very disappointing."
1382,__label1__,I receive this as a gift from my father and I really like this one. I wear it all the time and I get lot of compliments from my friends.
1383,__label1__,"My cat did not like this at all, I would think 1 star is just harsh to give a product and 3 star is decent enough so that is what I gave. My cat just smelled it and moved on."
1384,__label1__,"I began caring for light sensitive plants as an experiment and hoped that this product would help. It did not and my plants died as a result of the continuous replacement of bulbs. The bulk of the blame is on me for not knowing better, but the product is certainly not worth endorsing."
1385,__label1__,Signal was slightly boosted only if you were in a five foot range of the booster. Did not extend into other sections of my small house. Took it back to my local seller for a refund.
1386,__label1__,"This looks nice and was delivered fast. But, I cant hear through it properly because of the buzzing sound. Also, linking it with my device is such a hassle."
1387,__label1__,"This is a decent bed with lots of storage. It is huge, yes. If you took the time to read the measurements and actually measure the space in the room before buying it you will know what you are getting. I got this for my preteen-teen and he loves it. There is a LOT of storage in it. It will take several HOURS to put together and you need 2 people for some of it. Some of the material is less than stellar but for the price I was not expecting high quality wood. Only appropriate for older kids or teens. An adult would not appreciate having to climb into it at night."
1388,__label1__,"The worst experience ever .. it doesn t work at all , all the channels are freezing all the time. The customer service keep saying they r updating and solving the problems but nothing happened<br />Really its a waste of time and money"
1389,__label1__,"So first off, it is a lot darker than the picture, for us that was OK because we wanted something not that light, and by reading that review it was sold for us! The fact that it was so cheap, so big, and had non skid backing, we were sold. When it got here it was so much better in person! Beautiful, beautiful, it does feel a little cheap, but we don't care about that. After all it just goes under the dining room table to save our new floors. It's so perfect. 100%%% in love."
1390,__label1__,"Wallet is made of good quality materials, but the slots for credit cards are just barely wide enough, which may put a lot of stress on the leather and stitching as credit cards are taken in and out. I'm concerned about how well the wallet will stand up to normal use. We'll see."
1391,__label1__,"This product has palm oil in it, and as far as ""vegetable"" oils are concerned its one of the worst oils around. Yes, I suppose the palm oil is natural, but it's a saturated fat and it's NOT healthy. It also has added sugar. Other brands might be a better choice for health conscious consumers as it has only two ingredients, peanuts and salt."
1392,__label1__,"I used this kit with two vivitar flashes and it works great. I got another of the trigger kits to set up a third flash to get some extra light when I have a bigger photo-shot. Light stands were fairly heavy duty and I should be able to use them with my other mono lights. The triggers worked almost every time. I didn't use any sync cords, just mounted the transmitter on my camera and was all set to go. Took me less than 15 minutes to get everything out of the box, setup and start taking pictures."
1393,__label1__,I guess I should have read the negative reviews more carefully because this stylus results you get from this stylus are pretty poor for the high price they charge.<br /><br />The pen has several faults starting with where the power button is located. I had to constantly try and rotate the pen so I wouldn't hit the power button.  Very annoying<br /><br />Next the so called worlds best stylus couldn't even capture my signature any better than my cheap 5 dollar griffin stylus.<br /><br />I honestly feel like I was ripped off<br /><br />Ok so then I gave the stylus to my friend who is a professional graphic artist to test it and see if it was just me that was having issues.  After 10 minutes of use she told me this was not worth the money I spent and directed me to buy something different.<br /><br />I can say that this stylus does NOT take notes very well and you spend more time trying to correct the poor results than just trumping a note or using a cheapie stylus<br /><br />I've decided that my 5 dollar griffin will do better than this 70 dollar toy<br /><br />My search continues for a good active stylus<br /><br />Trust me and avoid this at all costs
1394,__label1__,"I didn't had any problems with this router, since I read all the positive reviews and decided to buy one for my newly purchased laptop. The problem started after my second firmware update. In the beginning everything was normal but after the update, router would constantly lose signal. Now, every 2 minutes my wifi disconnects for no apparent reason - and this didn't happened before, so I called support but they told me to reset the router, which I did, but problem continued. Luckily, I had a warranty so I returned the router.<br /><br />On my friend's recommendation, and he works at local internet service provider, I bought AC1759 Router ( http://amzn.to/13FE6I1 ), which didn't had any problem. I updated the last firmware and I didn't noticed a big change, so as long as it's working normally, I'm glad :)."

1396,__label1__,My package arrived faster than expected! Great service!!  This pole is not for super advanced pole tricks but it is perfect for having some fun and teasing your boyfriend. Make sure you secure it tightly and you shouldn't have any problems.
1397,__label1__,"Great phone but I am not a fan of the operating system. This is something you can't try out when buying over the internet. I recommend shopping in the stores to choose the phone, then go back to order for the rock bottom pricing."
1398,__label1__,"This bag is a good quality bag...however it does not meet most airlines restrictions for a carry-on and the two-compartment design is a little bizzarre. I do like the bag, but there is a compartment on top and a compartment below it. I think it would have been better if they had just made it with one compartment."

I want these to be my normal capri pants. I originally bought them to work out, but I want to wear these everywhere now."
1401,__label1__,"Bought the unit brand new during power outage to run my pellet stove and a light or two. Would just stop for no apparent reason. But after much fussing got it to run consistently, which it did for about another 6 hours then stopped permanently. There is no compression when I pull the starter cord, so I am assuming the rings or valves are shot."
1402,__label1__,Its a good camera. The only issue is that within the water proof case you cant adjust the zoom or switch modes. But its worth it
1403,__label1__,"I got this for my grandson because he was interested in architecutre. He wanted to learn the basics of drafting by hand because he wants to design cars some day. I hope he follows through with that dream. This set is a good quality starter to get him started. I took a look at it, and being in the drafting industry I consider myself a good judge."
1404,__label1__,"I had one of these for the longest time because my sister gave them to me and I forgot. When I saw the reviews on this though, I tried it and the product doesn't even do anything anymore. I kept it in a shelf, away from anything that could have damaged it too."
1405,__label1__,"lf you still didn't bought this, then this review can help you. I've been playing violin for 3 years now and I can recognize one when I see it. After I saw that this one was one of the bestselling here and that it had mostly positive reviews, I decided to buy one. After I received it I spotted bent neck and spotty craftsmanship. But the worst thing happened when I tried to play it. The sound was awful, and the strings were too stretched - definitely not my recommendation :/.    My friend, who's a violin player in orchestra, bought a Cecilio violin ( http://amzn.to/1xAJ6IL ), a week ago from Amazon and it was far more better than this one, Sound is better, and the craftsmanship is perfect, I just ordered the same :)."

1410,__label1__,This cream smell is very very bad. It is not a good product . Just I hate this cellulite remover cream.
1411,__label1__,"This thing died so fast that I had to check how long I've had it before it choked. Less than a month. I've had this for less than a month. If it wasn't a gift, I would have been very pissed."
1412,__label1__,The chair is very easy to build with little to no effort needed. The instruction can be a little overwhelming if you have difficulty understanding multiple steps in one window. The quality of the chair is very good for this price point. So far so good as we have had these chairs in an office setting for a few weeks now.

I got a couple bottles of this as a trial at a hotel.  Lather Bamboo Creme Hair Wash.  This stuff is AWFUL!!  As soon as I put it on my head and try to rub it in, my hair becomes a ratty mess!!  I don't know if it's because my hair is color treated, but this is unbelievable.  There should be a warning.  I spent 45 minutes brushing the rats out of my hair and had a very sore head for almost 2 days.  I don't know if these people bottled the stuff incorrectly, if hair wash means it's not shampoo and I am not supposed to rub my head or what, but I will NEVER buy this stuff and I will RUN from any hotel that offers it!!"

I bought the system before I had my baby boy, a couple of months ago, and I am not unhappy with either the pail or these bags.<br /><br />At the moment, my baby's diapers are very small and therefore, the bags do hold 25 diapers, quite easily.  However, I should imagine that as his diapers get bigger, the bags will hold less of them.  At the moment, it is a bit of a squeeze to get the bags out of the pail, but they never break.  They snap shut really easily and firmly, ensuring any smells are kept inside - which is ALWAYS a good thing with diapers.  I am very satisfied with these."
1420,__label1__,A lot smaller that I imagined. The picture looks great and it does look ok but I am not using it for what I intended. I wanted to use as a lounge chair but the back is too low and it's not long enough for someone 5'8&#34;. I would say if you are about 5'3&#34; it would work for you. Look at the measurements before making a purchase. I set it up after the 30 days so I had to make use of it. Nice to have the storage and I can sit in it for a bit just not to lounge for too long.
1421,__label1__,"Painful! It is just squeezing my hand, no massage at all.<br />If not the idea is really fresh to me, I will rate it one star."
1422,__label1__,"Bought this char weeks ago, can't remember how long has it been already, the chair is still sturdy, comfortable to use to be honest except I'm having second thoughts that I might fall because I lean too much and I'm a big and heavy man so hopefully it holds up ( well, it is until now ). The arm rest are pretty smooth too.  The chair itself is soft and pretty thick so it must be of a high quality. So far everything is good except for the wheels, I put on some oil into it since it makes this squeeze sound whenever I move."
1423,__label1__,We have a bunch of these at home. Trying out different brands and such. This is far from the best but its decent enough.
1424,__label1__,"I received this hat quickly. I like that it has Velcro tabs to hold it into the trifold shape. It also makes it possible to wear it without the trifold. The red ribbon hanging down gives it a splash of color. My granddaughter loves hats and was thrilled with it also. It is a good size, not overly huge on her head but not too small for mine either. It seems to be made of quality materials that will last for a while."

He wondered how I got Ethernet cable and in here it said wireless, so I had to put on other wall plug, which was hard, due to &#34;modern&#34; look of my house. Android app is also not helpful, it updates every hour or so and it really ruins the whole process, because I cannot stand by my mobile every time.<br /><br />Nevertheless, my friend who was lightning designer, said that I needed to buy a Phillips 2599 ( http://amzn.to/1wBs8pI ), because its completely wireless and it's easier to install it, he also bought a pack of them, a month ago and said he'll order more because of their quality."
1435,__label1__,This is an amazing bracelet. I wore it for the first time today and received so many compliments. Several gals wanted to try it on. It is well made and is much prettier than the picture. I wish there were earrings to match.

1437,__label1__,"Great way to count burned calories, I use it with my Ipod since I dont want t bring my iphone when doing runs. The price is just a little steep though considering its disposable."

1439,__label1__,This is awesome cover for my lappy. It looks so cool. Only one thing you need to take care while sticking it on your laptop or do it with any experienced person otherwise it will left with bubble.

1442,__label1__,"Plenty of slots for credit and other cards and room for cash and other necessities. A very nice looking wallet that is more than functional. For those who wear a suit or sport coat, this item should be considered. It will, however, stick out of most pants pockets, so not recommended for those who do not intend to use it in a jacket pocket."
1443,__label1__,This wax is great!<br /><br />It holds strong but you can still style it throughout the day. It doesn't leave the white flakes like hairspray does.
1444,__label1__,"Works as advertised but i hope that it came in different sizes for various windows. Good thing is that it can also be used in the car, when it gets too hot."
1445,__label1__,"I thought it didn't work with 6.1/7.1 cards as he indicated. I contacted the Buttkicker tech support folks and they informed me that is not true and said you need to turn on the ""low frequency redirect"" in your soundcard settings."

1447,__label1__,"Pros: Concept of a case with an attachable strap to work as an armband. That's really about it.<br />Cons: Silicone material does not work well for work outs or running, except maybe very light workouts. It sticks to the arm with no flexibility to allow free movement of the arm. I usually run 3-4 miles followed by 25 minutes of strength training. This armband was painful to wear for more than a mile. When I removed it after the run, the skin is flaming red in that spot.<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, but I think a more flexible material that doesn't cause so much friction would be better suited for this design. This material in itself is too painful to wear."
1448,__label1__,Very comfortable. Lots of padding. Plenty of room. Also this car-seat has the side impact for extra protection for your child. Really easy to adjust for the perfect fit. Great value.
1449,__label1__,Definitely recommend this chair to anyone who wants to have a great look to their house and be comfortable. Exactly as described with this product.
1450,__label1__,This crib is beautiful. I also ordered the bedding shown in this crib. It looks awesome together! My husband and father put it together and it only took about 15 minutes. Everything I have ever ordered from them is always damaged in some way. So beware.

1456,__label1__,"The book was fantastic. But I would rate the movie with just an 'okay'. Let me tell you why. It fails in delivering the emotions that you could feel when reading the book. The characters in this movie are crafted after the nowadays heroes theme. And that's too commercial for my tastes. Indeed, the film delivers excelent entertainment and the effects are very realistic. It's a good movie, but the book is better."
1457,__label1__,"It is a nice watch. I had to have 2 links removed so it would fit my wrist. I am slightly disappointed, as the face of the watch is larger than I anticipated (or wanted). Another review compared it to the size of a quarter and it is definitely larger than a quarter."
1458,__label1__,My friend bought for her dog gloria she didn't like it at all. I asked if I could have it and it doesn't bother my max. Only thing is after washed doesn't look new and a little bally

1463,__label1__,This is a good adaptor and it does not compromise volume at all. It does not have any ticks or issues that I have yet to notice. I am very pleased with the performance.
1464,__label1__,"Well made keyboard...<br /><br />Getting the keys off to clean or replace is a nightmare.  I had to open one of these to fix a spill on a friends and about 4 of them broke.  Not on the X lifter but on the KEY itself....  the Snap-in part is made of such thin and brittle plastic you better hope you never have to take them off.<br /><br />The saving grace?<br /><br />If someone breaks with it and you are still in the warranty period Logitech will send you a new one.  Totally free!  They do not even ask for you to return the broken one.... Mainly because of what I saw when i disassembled it,  The membrane is unrepairable if opened up to clean circuit leads."
1465,__label1__,"I am a small woman with small ears so, the size of these earrings was perfect for me. They were beautiful and dainty. The color is exactly what I was going for (although the color of the pearl on the earrings was different than on the necklace). The problem was these earrings were so flimsy that they started to bend upon opening the lever-back. Not good. I was afraid I might rip my earring hole trying to get these off. If they weren't so malleable, they would be awesome."
1466,__label1__,"One of my Christmas gifts, was pretty excited to use it with my iPod Touch, since it was collecting dust after getting an iPad.

Contacted Griffin direct, turned out to be a bad remote, wasn't transmitting signals, after a half hour on the phone, they said they would send another one, they did, pooped in on the iPod, and this time, it transmitted signals, now what signals it was transmitting I have no idea, it was so faulty and clumsy even my wife was laughing. Would give zero stars if I could."
1467,__label1__,The set up was easy- the printer has great quality- so far so good!! Great price! A little noisy when printing but the quality of print makes up for it. Happy with this product- just replaced another brands' printer and glad I did!
1468,__label1__,My three month old grandson loves his bath time so much in this bath tub. His parents place it in the kitchen sink where he enjoys looking out the window while splashing & kicking in his very own jacuzzi.
1469,__label1__,Great sturdy pockets. Great for all your needs. I know most people will wish to have deeper pockets but from the design you can't really add deep pockets or else the entire item would hang much too low on the back of the seat.
1470,__label1__,"This is actually a good product to have, though I wouldn't say that it's the best. If I have one complaint about it, it's the fact that it's plastic which makes me nervous."
1471,__label1__,Just recieved it today. Shipped to me fast..received it in just a little over a week from placing the order...took 3hrs to put together. It was tough. To tired to try it out tonight but after all this hard work and back ache...it better be worth it!!!
1472,__label1__,"I love this stabilizer!

1475,__label1__,"Easy of operation,storage of bits is very innovative, you can adjust the driving force/torque to some extent....overall very user friendly..."
1476,__label1__,This bag's handles are non-existent. They are so short you cannot get your hand underneath them to get into the bag. I loved the look of the bag online but found it could only be worn as a shoulder bag.
1477,__label1__,Very disappointed at how quickly this tarnishes and gets a greenish tint where the water goes. I do not have hard water and none of my other fixtures have this problem.
1478,__label1__,"I bought this for my 9year old cousin. It was a great success! He played with it for a little over 1 hour on the first charge. Re-charged which took about 3 hours and went for another hour.<br /><br />He was using it in the driveway, it went over the street curb many times. The battery did not fall out like many of his other cars do.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because the top speed seemed to max out at 10MPH."
1479,__label1__,"Sorry, I got a tape where the first few inches tries were just dry.  Then it got better further along.  Just be careful. you might not get what you wanted with this."
1480,__label1__,I love gummi bears and Haribo is just the best! I use it for sugar rush while mountain climbing...or doing any other strenuous activity. I love the taste and the gumminess is incomparable!!!
1481,__label1__,"Using this projector is so frustrating that I actually screamed a little during a staff meeting. We were supposed to be doing a presentation, but after the images just could not be shown in any clear manner, we just gave up on it altogether."
1482,__label1__,This bear is so soft and cuddly! perfect newborn baby gift or for a young child. something they will be able to hug and love unlike some of those stiff stuffed animals out there.
1483,__label1__,"I take the bus everywhere I go, and a backpack is absolutely necessary. I have a few different backpacks I switch out every now and then, and this is one of them. I think it's a great little pack, honestly. It looks great, for one, and is made with good, sturdy materials that are able to stand up to a lot of use. The zippers are especially nice, very high quality. I can carry it or wear it, and either way it's highly functional. Lots of space inside, too. It didn't smell great when I first got it, though, like a very strong kind of fake smell, but it dissipated after a few hours being out of the shipping material. Weird, but I didn't let it deter me. Still works, and I really like it."
1484,__label1__,"For culinary quality, it is not bad. I would not consider it ceremonial quality however, but that is not what is advertised. It is a tad bit expensive though."
1485,__label1__,"This is a great nabber. It is very sturdy and It picks up well but the grip handle hurts your hand after a while. In general, I am pleased with the grabber."
1486,__label1__,"Our kids loved watching movies on long drives. It was much less expensive than a built-in system, too. We bought, just 8 months later, it broke. The latch that keeps the DVD player closed would pop open when we drove over bumps."
1487,__label1__,"You get what you pay for.  It's limited in the tilt feature, but that was not a prerequisite going in for me. It does the job but the fan is weak, can't satisfy me with the air it blows."
1488,__label1__,"As usual, I was excited to use this router in my three story house and get a full signal at all times. Although, that couldn't be further from what happened... This thing dropped signal so often, I couldn't get anything done!<br /><br />This was so hard for me, after spending so much money and to be worse off than I was before.<br /><br />After I dealt with returning this router and researching as much as possible I found a GREAT router that hasn't given me a single issue in any way.<br /><br />If you want to take a look, it is here on Amazon --------&#62; http://amzn.to/1hQmOP7<br /><br />Even if you decide it's not the router for you, at least I got to share my experience with this one."
1489,__label1__,"For the money, this is a good scope. Has good eye relief, but does have parrelex. Lenses are slightly cloudy on the inside. It is good enough for my 22mag Marlin, but I don't think I would use it on anything high power."
1490,__label1__,"Super cheap looking in person. Bad quality fabric. Nothing I liked about this at all.The apron size is very small, for the children but not for the adults."
1491,__label1__,"This was provided by a workshop aimed at improving student learning, but it only led to frustration on the part of the students as well as the educators that participated. The quality was simply awful."
1492,__label1__,"It never made sense to me that a driver needed to cost $300. You're just whacking something hard for distance. This cheap driver with its big head is perfect for someone new to the game and not deadly serious. I only picked up playing golf in the last years and still don't want to commit my children's inheritance to the past time. If you're looking for a good hard hitting driver and don't want to spend a small fortune, this is the one."
1493,__label1__,"I'm not sure what everyone is all crying about, but my bibs look exactly like the pic! They seem good quality too. I didn't give it 5 stars because I haven't used them and my baby is not here yet. I will soon."
1494,__label1__,"The fit is good and comes just slightly below his waste . Although the cost was very reasonable, this vest is top quality.this product is very Good realy like this vest it is my favorite."
1495,__label1__,I'm sorry I REALLY tried to like this thing but it was a little noisy to begin with but I like the extra charging ports.... It has been slowly dying since we hooked it up.  Now the fan doesn't work at all.  I would not purchase again.
1496,__label1__,"Arrived late, to my dismay, so I re-scheduled my appointment. Took it to the blue and yellow big box store along with the pioneer deck and was advised by the stereo manager it is not allowed (for legal reasons i don't want to elaborate on) to have installed in TN and I was asked to take it home with me by the blue and yellow big box store car stereo manager. They made sure I would not slip it to anyone in the bay... Waiting on seller for a month now to send me a call tag for the return and my refund."
1497,__label1__,"If you aren't as advanced and just want a solid wireless signal for the money, this is the one to get."
1498,__label1__,"Use this product and never make a mistake with your measurements unless you have extremely poor eyesight. If so, get it checked."
1499,__label1__,I really love this scarf. I received this on my birthday and I am very happy to have this one. I like the texture and its design.
1500,__label1__,"As I am eating daily these candies (even though they might have a lot of sugar and I am risking my diet), because they taste great. However, I found lower prices in other places."
1501,__label1__,I have ordered these brushes around April and it came very late and the brush looked to cheap and 2 of them were broken it was disappointed for me and my customers
1502,__label1__,"Made out of cheap plastic material that feels will rip very easily, but then again you get what you pay for. I just needed something cool for my 6 year old to sit on while playing xbox or watching tv coz he always sat on the floor coz the couch was too far. All in all it works out fine, just wish they were made a little more tough."
1503,__label1__,Bought these thinking they would be good to eat and help me with my diet and all but I was wrong.  They don't taste good to me at all.  I actually put hot sauce on as I ate them.
1504,__label1__,"Ordered these as gifts. They fit properly, i.e. sufficient depth to crown. Sizing is just a little smaller than the Panama hats we own. Seems like a good value, only time will tell."
1505,__label1__,"In my opinion this is a good start to a system.<br /><br />This is fine for a bedroom or smaller sized living area. This will not replace your surround sound system. The wattage rating and speaker size reinforces this point. That being said, the quality of the tower is up to par.<br /><br />* Quality enclosure<br />* No assembly required<br />* iPod mates to tower<br />* Remote mates to iPod<br />* Secure line Jacks<br />* MP3 Aux-in Jack<br />* FM radio with 20 preset<br />* Composite video output<br /><br />These are all good working features and those without functional glitches.<br /><br />An area that could be improved:<br /><br />AM stations seem to be non-existent. Perhaps FM stations are only received.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />The tower is priced well and the quality of the audio is very good. We purchased the tower for our sons room and in that space the tower works well."
1506,__label1__,This product is so cheaply made it is unbelievable. The sound quality is terrible. When you insert a cassette be careful not to bend the pin that sticks out inside of the unit that fasten in the cassette. The radio will not even begin to pick up weak stations. My wife wants to keep it because it is portable.
1507,__label1__,"This pen is exceptional for the price. Smooth writing, nib glides over paper, ink flow is perfect. This is my new favorite pen. The only complaint - The box it comes in is some cheap plastic thing."
1508,__label1__,"These doormats do take the dirt off your shoes, but don't try to step on them with bare feet. I often go out on to my front porch in bare feet and the first time I stepped on this mat, yikes! If you plan to be in bare feet I suggest another type of mat. Otherwise, very functional although not really attractive. I think I'll limit to the back porch!"
1509,__label1__,"Took the poles out for the first time this Saturday and already one of the poles has broken. They are cheap and cheaply made, will be returned Monday morning for something of better quality."
1510,__label1__,"I could barely tolerate the taste and texture of these wraps and I'm usually a very tolerant person who can eat anything. Once, I ate an entire plate of pasta that was both burned and uncooked. I could not figure out how that happened, even now."
1511,__label1__,"My daughter had a problem getting my grandson to eat his veggies. At one of his checkups the doctor did a blood test. We were told his iron was low, because lack of veggies in his diet. I bought her some of the food products, he just loved them."
1512,__label1__,"This was a pretty far-fetched piece of work, and that's putting it mildly. If I look at it as a form of entertainment, I supposed it works. But I have a feeling that that's not what the author intended."
1513,__label1__,"My husband has long, thin fingers on delicate, lean hands. This makes the gloves a little too large for him even though the size was supposed to be right. That was my mistake though."
1514,__label1__,"This unit is doing its job, in terms of navigation. It gets GPS signal (not very fast, but it gets...) and it does not have huge location errors. It looks good and the remote control is also very handy. Unfortunately, the maps updating process is almost impossible."
1515,__label1__,"They do not require huge force to work perfectly. They don't splatter mouse guts all over the place or make a bloody mouse mess. Also, they don't really hurt if they release on your finger (hard to do since you're finger is never in the trap). They grab and suffocate the mouse. Awesome design, works terrific, an ant could set it off and it's practically impossible for mice to raid the bait without triggering the trap so even tiny mice get got."
1516,__label1__,"This car charger is definitely on the cheap side. It feels very ""plasticy"" and is extremely light and unattractive..<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />It does work, at least it has worked so far for the last few weeks as I use it daily on my commute to work and back.<br /><br />I bought another, more expensive charger for my husband (he has an iPhone 4S) and it just seems more reliable, especially when plugging it in and pulling it out.<br /><br />Other reviewers have had some very bad experiences with this product so if you want to roll the dice and try your luck, give this charger a go. For a few bucks, even if it breaks, it's not the end of the world...<br /><br />My recommendation is to pay a little more and get a better quality Apple iPhone charger."
1517,__label1__,I am very disappointed by this case. I waste good money down the drain. I should have done some deep research in finding the case for my phone.
1518,__label1__,Terrific value. My husband just wishes that these jeans came in a 35&#34; waist which would then make them a perfect fit!
1519,__label1__,It must be my perspective. I love the glasses Joan wears and when I saw the &#34;oversized&#34; offer I thought just what I want. Not. I have the &#34;regular&#34; Joan glasses and the oversize were not as big as I would have liked. I can go spin the sun glass carousel at my upscale clothing store and find bigger. I will keep them because I like the style.
1520,__label1__,"It is great outside by the pool. If forget to bring it in, it's ok cause it will not hurt the speaker."
1521,__label1__,"It was too hard for my 11 week old puppy. She check it out, mouthed it and never touched it again. Maybe when she gets larger"
1522,__label1__,I am in love with this watch! It is heavy and bigger than I thought it would be but I am not disappointed at all. I have received exceptional reviews from my peers about this watch. I refuse to tell them where I got it b/c I am greedy that way.
1523,__label1__,I found that it is great on toasted gluten free bread. Also I can use it in recipes by substituting it for sugar. I love the easy cap it is so CUTE!! And it is well shipped without any damage.
1524,__label1__,"Adds some effect to the photo if you use this during a photo shoot. When I zoom it out until 18mm the edges of the hood can be seen, so I just avoid zooming it out to the extremes but I can deal with it."
1525,__label1__,"I personally feel that Lord of the Ring is better than this, but overall this movie is good. I know what happened before Lord of the Ring such as how they get the ring and also the elven blade. Still, I like the best is....PRECIOUS!!!!"
1526,__label1__,This is a real simple game and ur friends are gonna make fun of you when you get it out. Cause it looks like something kids would play. But then get a few drinks in ya and everybody takes it all serious. Great game really.
1527,__label1__,Product is very nice and good looking. Only thing is once it was put together we notice a handle on it was broken. But overall good. Maybethey can contact us to fix this problem.
1528,__label1__,"It arrived way before the estimated delivery date, which is awesome. The quality is very good, it's really worth the price."
1529,__label1__,"They are good products and put out the amount of light I expected. On sale, the price was very good, which I why I leaped. But you always have to look at how long it will take you to recoup the money you spent on the bulb vs the amount of electricity you saved."
1530,__label1__,"I thought it would be more of an accent, but was pleasantly surprised to find that it was bright enough to light up the whole room. The ""paper"" shading does soften the light though making it easy to function without a glare. It takes the tiny E12 bulbs (three of them). Another nice feature is the on/off foot switch. It was incredibly easy to assemble (i think it took me a grand total of two minutes to put it together and plug it in)."
1531,__label1__,"For an advanced book, it's difficult to read and understand. I found numerous mistakes and errors. The structure of the book is poor and lacks in-depth information on using advanced features and tools."
1532,__label1__,"I bought this for my nephew, it looks okay to me. It functions well and it's very cute in actual. Great product!"
1533,__label1__,"These shoes are fantastic!!! They are exactly what we were looking for. Excellent price, excellent value!!! So comfortable and great fit."
1534,__label1__,Great for all babies! Including those with respiratory and colic problems! Magic wonder! We Love it! Should have for the baby. One of the good sleeper for babies from the fisher price.
1535,__label1__,"It's not very engaging for my son. We have a notepad of lined paper from the dollar store, and I can write letters for him to trace just as easily."
1536,__label1__,Bought this a month ago to replace my ageing HP deskjet all in one. It has all the features you'd expect in a modern all in one.
1537,__label1__,It provided extended life for a few days only. After that it functions about the same as the stock battery. A waste of money.
1538,__label1__,Broke within a week. Very disappointing . Went to best buy and got a new one . Sorry cant rate it more then 2 star !
1539,__label1__,I mounted this on a ruger 10/22 and it works great! The only thing I had to do was shim (piece of cardboard) the rear scope ring because it shot a little high even after using all the elevation adjustment.
1540,__label1__,"The case is a little bulky but does an amazing job of protecting my phone. I forgot my iPhone on the roof of my car and drove off. The phone finally blew off the roof, bounced off my trunk and down the highway at 45mph. I pulled over and retrieved my phone. The case was slightly chipped in one corner but the phone was completely unharmed!"
1541,__label1__,It won't stay open and it's a chore to open the lid every time I need to tap off cigarette ashes. Will not buy from niceeshop ever again!!!
1542,__label1__,This product does meet my needs. I use these dividers in binders. The insert able extend outside of the normal standard size papers. My binders are much neater; thanks to these dividers.
1543,__label1__,"This player shoots all the blu rays at your face in a manner that you would expect. It doesn't have wireless, so that's minus a star I guess. It hasn't cut me once. Great price, plays digital discs. Go for it!"
1544,__label1__,"Its like it was never replaced. As good as the original, i am actually thinking of getting an extra just in case another room needs one."
1545,__label1__,"This movie is almost two and a half hours long. All-in-all it is a fun take on the old tale. (no new plot here, save for the in depth look at Tonto's past) Some Texas Rangers get ambushed and only one survives, leaving a Lone Ranger. A dead brother who's wife loved them both at one point, gives us a great damsel, add her impressionable son, a corrupt train mogul, a scary outlaw who eats parts of his victims, and a pair of hero's that carry the film with their antics, and you've got a good western romp. Depp plays a great Tonto, especially, the old Tonto that starts the flick.  My only negative is this: Two hours of  s - l - o - w  build up for thirty minutes of over the top climax is not that great of a ratio for a film. Thirty minutes of it could have been edited out and the thing would have been perfect.  4 stars, A ""Must See"" for fans of westerns, Depp, and The Lone Ranger. - MR"
1546,__label1__,"But I don't think I like it that much. The story is fine and the writing was decent. I guess I'm just not the audience the author was aiming for. For those who liked it though, I say good for them."
1547,__label1__,"i have been using earth's best organic whole grain rice cereal for my two kids and never saw any negative in it,they love it and this motivate me to buy it for them."
1548,__label1__,"I definitely got a fake product. I've used nioxin before and it was OK. Did not gain any hair, but did not lose any hair either. I ordered this here off amazon and not only does it smell different then the stuff I had before, but its made my hair shed like crazy. I returned it asap and had a long talk with an amazon representative. Unfortunately without more complaints, they won't look into if this is a fake product or not. Save yourself the trouble..."
1549,__label1__,This year I bought a third bottle thinking that last year's malfunction was a one-off. After 5 minutes of spraying I noticed that the bottle contents weren't going down. I tried resetting the on/off a couple of times but it still wasn't delivering the contents.
1550,__label1__,"OH MEMORY!!!!<br />I had this CD player during my teenage, this is a Christmas gift from my father. And I had spend much more time with it, and it's the best memory in my life. Thanks to SONY and the great artist!"
1551,__label1__,"Got this antenna yesterday and hooked it up right away. My first scan I got 32 channels. After a bit if adjustment, I got 40 channels. Great picture, great sound.I would have given it a five but I took off a star because the mounting bracket was not what was pictured. The bracket I got is very flimsy."
1552,__label1__,"The main issue with this is the sound, it doesn't matter if you have the mute on or off, you sit it on the table the sound mutes you tap it on the back the sound comes back, yet after this i got a replacement and it died in 2 days."
1553,__label1__,I am originally from Morocco so I know argan oil.<br /><br />I have families in the South Western hills of Morocco and deals with hundreds of people who work in the argan oil business.<br />This argan oil is very poor quality and doesn't have the nutrients. It seems it was heavily processed or mixed with another oil.<br />It is Definitely NOT PURE and would not recommend it.
1554,__label1__,"The headsets never worked well at my computer, it hissed and popped. I waited a full day to let it charge, it died in the first few minutes. I may try another one; this may just be a fluke."
1555,__label1__,This is not the most secure item in the world and it would be hard to trust this with your oven's security.
1556,__label1__,"I got this protector but was afraid of bubbles but when I placed it on, I just noticed it got smooth. Not a single bubble left and perfect fit."
1557,__label1__,You can't use this aluminum foil for much of anything if you are wrapping something that has an edge. Find something smooth like a ball if you don't want to throw it away. Nice try with the recycled marketing though.
1558,__label1__,"i love that it zips up to a compact size. i actually bought 2 of these, 1 for each of my sons for our family vacation coming up. i was not expecting them to be so roomy, they could probably share 1 bag."
1559,__label1__,"leather office furniture from flash furniture is very comfy,bought it and and i can work the whole day with no sign of tiredness,the nylon arms makes it even more comfortable."
1560,__label1__,"The rug itself is lovely and will be perfect in my kids' play room - provided I can get it clean. Unfortunately as another reviewer stated, it was shipped only wrapped in a plastic bag which torn at one end leaving the rug dirty on that end. Disappointing."
1561,__label1__,"It is hard to say that something is a bad buy when it is only $5 but this set is very low quality. I am concerned that if I use a socket with any tongue that I will break it or spin it. Even at the price, I would not buy another."
1562,__label1__,Our baby girl isn't here yet but we are very pleased with this car seat so far. It's the cutest print and is fairly easy to install. Also easy to adjust straps. It arrived quickly and the packaging was in good shape.
1563,__label1__,"My niece just got her PS Vita, so I got her this so that she can get started with her enjoyment with a little more completion. If you're going to get addicted to games anyway, you might as well go with it all the way."
1564,__label1__,I ordered this product for my home office. I am very disappointed with it. The surface of the mat is so rough my chair does not roll easily. The top of this mat does not need to be textured. I am extremely disappointed with this product and would not recommend it to anyone.
1565,__label1__,"I drink coffee all day & I usually have a full bodied coffee, but this did not meet my expectations. Although a nice flavor, it's too weak for my taste. I ended up using more coffee, per cup, than I would normally use."
1566,__label1__,"I'm not ambitious in terms of playing keyboards or any musical instrument so this set is great for me. I'm learning quite a bit and I'm progressing along. However, you have to understand that you are not getting the best deal all around with this."
1567,__label1__,"For 50 bucks, I didn't expect much. But boy ... I was in for a surprise. While not stupendously accurate, these headphones present a laid back, non-fatiguing sound, sith no noise when turned to max. Sound is very clear bot on high and low frequency. There are very good headphones, maybe even the best you can get for 50 $."
1568,__label1__,"This actually worked for my maltese. When I moved to a townhouse, my floor is too high and it's a hassle for me to go al the way down just to walk Coco. It's very easy to clean up though a bitt too expensive coz you have to change the mat at least twice a week."
1569,__label1__,"I have been using this product since 4 weeks, it has really helped me to correct my flaws during workouts esp. with over tiring. Great product for all who workout."
1570,__label1__,"I bought the cheap one, you can buy everywhere with a pump. The ballons were hard to twist and p;op right away"
1571,__label1__,"These push up bars are  well-made, and the cushioned handles are a nice feature. They even seem a bit taller than my old pair, which should help in giving me better workout results"
1572,__label1__,they sound good and are super cheap.i use these when i sleep and they are still in perfect shape. sometimes when i wake up they arent in my ears anymore
1573,__label1__,I hate the product. It is very bad product not great quality.  I purchased the product for my daughter 1 month ago and my daughter not pleased used the product. She tried using it again with a non-rubber pacifier. Same thing. Weird smell that caused my daughter to reject her pacifier. Save yourself the trouble and ruined pacifiers and buy another brand.<br />I would tell anyone purchase it. I always hate the product.
1574,__label1__,Gatorade has always been our family's go-to thirst quencher. It is a real shame we can no longer get this product at our local store. Thank goodness for it is still available in the online store.
1575,__label1__,"This pool looked beautiful till we put water in it! Noticed puddles outside the pool but could not find where it was leaking from. Dried up the water on the outside and tried to watch where the leak was but could not see any at all, tried the dye test as well to no avail."
1576,__label1__,"This is not a stand alone remedy for getting fleas. This however is a good  added measure in between spraying your house and bathing your pooch. You will see the fleas inside in a couple of days, proof that it does work."
1577,__label1__,"This product does not work with my iPhone. If you want quality then look a little further, but if you just need a cheap charger and don't mind keep spending money then this is the product for you!!! It's very cheap so you get what you pay for...."
1578,__label1__,"I love these, my wife bought it for me and it's superb, the design is classic. It looks better than the picture. This is really a great, she really knows my taste. Though price seems high for me, but all in all its a great purchase. My wife is really the best. :)"
1579,__label1__,"The Spa arrived earlier than first scheduled which was nice. Getting it to the site was a bit difficult, you would be advised to have one or two people to assist, but once that's completed it is outstanding, very well built and attractive."
1580,__label1__,I would not buy this if you are a grown adult. Maybe for a teenager or younger. The headset is so small that it has not fit my friends or me in our 20's. It's almost painful to have on after 30 minutes of gaming. While the sound quality is incredible it is not worth the discomfort.
1581,__label1__,"I was not happy with this unit, error messages often and of course no warranty from the seller in China!"
1582,__label1__,"water would not come out, heater did not work, would not suck up any water that did come out and front of machine had stress cracks from the screws and the bottom where the brushes are is all cracked."
1583,__label1__,"I've tried lots of professionally made swimming caps both used for competitions or practices. I can say that it's a decent quality swim cap with very good materials used, fits comfortably and doesn't penetrate by water. I am satisfied with my purchase."
1584,__label1__,"I'm sorry, I just didn't like this. It tastes like medicine and nobody likes drinking medicine when they don't have too. The ginger tastes is way overpowering, almost like drinking gingersnap cookies and I don't mean that in a good way."
1585,__label1__,"It's a comfortable mattress, though it feels a bit thin. When you hit hard on the mattress, you can feel the spring. Overall it's a comfortable one."
1586,__label1__,It took me 20 tries before the addons would finally install. After that not all of them even worked.<br />I should have just have saved the money and not bought.
1587,__label1__,I didn't realize that these speakers work at 900 MHz until I opened the box. Unfortunately there is quite a lot of static on both speakers. The amount of static changes depending on where I position the speakers. I guess there are just too many gadgets out there these days that use this frequency band which makes it hard for these speakers to compete. I am going to have to get these exchanged for a model that is more robust.
1588,__label1__,this player saved our family from going crazy . we moved into a new house and had to wait 10 days for cable. this was on 24-7 during that time. did a great job..sound is great .
1589,__label1__,Tehy are smaller than advertised but they are so fun. GOTTA CATCH EM ALL! GOTTA CATCH EM ALL! POKE MON!
1590,__label1__,"Light fixture is exactly as advertised. Matches perfectly with my furniture handles. Individual lights do not have a switch. Doesn't matter to me, but might to others."
1591,__label1__,"Yes, these pasta's provided me with a good and proper taste. But their price is way to high for the quantity which can be found in one box. I was expecting a higher amount of pastas to be found inside. Considering the above mentioned statement, I cannot recommend them. Their taste is good, but not that excellent. I will stick with the common pastas."
1592,__label1__,I will briefly describe but then ask specifically for if they have improved this most obvious weakness before purchasing. The crank connects directly to the lift ring of the umbrella through a string that feeds through the main pole.
1593,__label1__,The picture and pricing is very deceiving i would not recommend. It look like you can buy this at a dollar store instead i would not have waste my money on it. Really list price at $99 so not worth it.
1594,__label1__,I have one with a smaller burner which i was not happy with due to only cooking what is in the center of the pan and i almost lost my morning omlette because the pan lost its balance. i dont really see any weakness unless the pot holder weld breaks..then there would be no way to hold a pot.. the actual burner would still work.. but no way to hold a pot on it.. at that point some well placed rocks holding the pot would be needed..thats my idea of reliable..
1595,__label1__,This leaks just a little bit. It's not a huge deal when you consider the fact that its a cheap plastic sandbox. But it does bother me a little.
1596,__label1__,"good!!<br />and very skinny.<br />and Fat is revealed.<br />so, my husband needs diet.<br />we likes swimming. so we'll go to swim pool with my son."
1597,__label1__,"I'm not going to give you all the specs because it's been done better by other reviewers, but I'm going to chime in and say this is a great grid tie inverter at an inexpensive price."

1604,__label1__,"I had high hopes for this movie. Winona Ryder's in it, after all. But those hopes were quickly dashed once I got into this corny and very stupid movie. Our hero, a rather studly guy played by Simon Baker, gets an e-mail with the names of all the girls he's been to bed with and all the ones he is going to bed. However, he's just about to tie the knot. Now if you were a stud would you get married, if you all of a sudden knew you were going to bed a gaggle of gals in the very near future?<br /><br />Winona plays Death Nell, a goth girl who goes around putting guys to sleep. She give them a potion and they go into a coma. Well, she inadvertently kills one. Naturally she's the last girl on the list and Mr. Stud doesn't want to go there, but can he help himself, can he quit taking good looking hotties to bed, even if he wants to? That is the question and that question is so silly that you might want to give this movie a pass. Still, it didn't suck, so if you're in the video store and can't decide what to get, Winona Ryder is in the movie and that has to account for something."

1607,__label1__,I have extensively used this unit for about 10 days now. I highly recommend it. The interface is different than the other device and takes some getting used to. Fortunately my brother has had the same unit with a smaller hdd for over a year and he shortened my learning curve.

Not impressed?.
1610,__label1__,The product arrived defective. We plugged it in right out of the box without anyone touching it except for my husband and it did nothing.
1611,__label1__,This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it. She likes the way it looks on her arm and the way it catches the light.

1621,__label1__,These chairs were dirty. The color of the canvas is not even close to the represented add. The screws were all stripped. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1622,__label1__,"My daughter  is very independent when it comes to eating and would always grab my fork when I put food on her plate. I realized that he needed her own, but our forks are a bit too sharp for her to use while he's learning. The prongs help him pick up her food and they all lay flat so nothing falls off. The handle makes it really easy for her to hold too."
1623,__label1__,"I understand not getting great balls for this price, but the balls I received were yellowish and peeling.

1637,__label1__,"The Perfect Fitness Ab Carver Pro was the first piece of equipment I purchased when I decided to create a home gym.  Along with this, a jump rope, and a waist trimmer belt, I lost 70 pounds over the past 7 months.  If you are just starting out, I'd recommend it be the first piece of equipment you get as well because it allows you to focus on the most important part of the body, THE CORE, which you should focus on first especially when you are just getting started or back into a workout routine.<br />I am not what you would call a bargain shopper (more like an impulse buyer ha) because if I were, I would have realized that you can get this same brand, and same model at Walmart for 10 dollars less than what it is selling for on amazon which is currently $39.95.  The Ab-Carver Pro is available on the Walmart web site right now for $29.77, so with the added tax (how does Amazon get away with not charging tax btw), you'll still save a fist full of dollars.<br /><br />If that is still too steep for you, and I totally understand if it is - still a lot of money to spend on a couple pieces of plastic, the best priced ab wheel I found on here appears to be this one for only $7.00 - [[ASIN:B00J0F3DR8 Wacces Ab Power Wheel Ab Roller]].  So, that is a good price, a great price actually.  Now you are probably asking yourself if you can get an ab wheel for such a ridiculously low price and it will do the job, then why on earth would you spend almost six times that amount and get the Ab Carver Pro!?<br /><br />While I think it may be overpriced, there are TWO key features on the Ab Carver Pro which make me not regret the purchase.  I only regret not getting it at Walmart lol.<br /><br />Key Feature #1:  The Wheel size is very very wide.  This makes a huge difference especially in the beginning.  The wider wheel provides more stability and the increased stability gives room for a greater range of motion which means more muscles are being contracted during the movement.  This translates into getting and seeing results a lot quicker.  When I first started, I highly doubt I could have even completed one full rep on a classic ab wheel but on this I was able to do sets of 6-7 full reps from day one.<br /><br />TIP FOR BEGINNERS:  Start on a wall, no kidding.  Lean into the wall at about 45% angle and start with higher reps of 15 up to 30.  Once you can do three full sets of 30 reps take it to the mat (or the knee pads they provide which I don't use personally)!<br /><br />Key Feature #2:  The Contoured handles really help with different angles.  Thr great thing about not being in the gym is I'm not stuck in those ab machines which force you to move in one range of motion over and over again hitting the same muscle fibers the same way, every time.  The handles it easy to hit every angle of your ab and core by moving in slightly different directions with each repettiton. With the Ab Carver, you can literally move in 20 different angles and better still, it doesn't bother my wrists either (like typing this review does for example!).<br /><br />The only other two pieces of equipment I have used and still use in my ""home gym"" are, as I mentioned earlier, a jump rope and a waist trimmer belt.<br /><br />I went through a couple jump ropes before landing on this one;  [[ASIN:B00GGKPCPG Buy Jump Ropes Double Unders Jump Rope]].  My biggest tip here is to make sure you get one that is adjustable in length like this one.  If its too long you're not going to be able to pick up enough speed when you get good at it for it to be effective and if its too short, then your going to have painful welts on your forehead and on the top of your head for a while!<br /><br />I went through more than a couple waist trimmers belts unfortunately until I found the one I own now.  Many of these belts are, to be frank; crap.  They are thrown together without much effort and after you sweat in it a few times, it starts to fall apart.  I've been using the one I have now for the past 6 months, so as hard as it is to do, I think this particular belt actually changed my mind about ab trimming belts in general.  I always wear this during my cardio (i.e. running outside) and especially when I use the jump ropes.  I would not suggest wearing one while you are using the Ab Carver but for cardio and jumping rope this thing will make you sweat in the midsection and burn calories like no tomorrow.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00KWIOF2Y TNT Waist Trimmer Ab Belt: Stomach Fat Burner & Toner &#x2605; Extra Wide to Cover Entire Midsection &#x2605; Uniquely Designed to Repel Sweat & Moisture w/ Anti-Slip Grid Technology &#x2605; No Slipping or Movement of Fabric! Premium Body Shaper, Slimm...]]<br /><br />I love the ab carver, adore my jump ropes, and I'm wearing my waist trimmer right now as I type this review (no kidding!)...but none of these tools would have done a darn thing to help me reach my weight loss goals if I didn't first lay the foundation with a set of healthy eating habits.  I hate the word diet, so I'll use ""healthy eating habits"".  These pieces of equipment I've mentioned will help, but if you want to really see those abs ya got to watch what eat.  And trust me I wish there was a way around this one because I love salty food but there is most certaintly not - Good luck friends!"

1642,__label1__,"I love oil of this products I use the complete with no scent or sensitive. But this one is more expensive. But the main problem is the aroma.

1643,__label1__,"This toy is very small, the pack contains all three but it's not worth the price for all three plush toys. It's looks very cheap also...."

The CX Blaster launcher felt like it was made from lower quality rubber and there was visible wear after an afternoon of heavy use.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun toy but I wouldn't really suggest the CX Blaster over one of the Bam Launchers."

1649,__label1__,"This product works as required, it's easy to read and easy to use, and the price was right! No complaints."
1650,__label1__,There is a constant hissing noise overlapping the audio. I tried everything from changing the volume on the wireless unit and my HT receiver but the hissing persists. If the audio is fairly loud the hissing is less noticeable. However it is pretty obvious during silent passages. Definitely not as good as hard wiring the speakers.

1654,__label1__,"You would imagine that the title of this review refers to the fact that this camera is much more than a point and shoot. Unfortunately it' s not. The fact that it needs a dozen of settings to run, makes it quite complicated and you might miss a few good photos because of that.

It constantly moves around and constantly losing grip of the belt. We have to, of course, fix it constantly as well so it gets annoying. Other than that, it’s easy to clean, no stinky odors are stuck to it and my dog seems loving it. I just hope there’s a better way to fix the moving around seat cover problem.

1674,__label1__,Easy to read and use. Love the soft silicon cover that it came with it. Great to keep track of my pulse rate when am working out or running.

1676,__label1__,The strap arrived very quickly and was easy to attach. Once on the camera it creates a very awkward angle and you must depress the shutter button with your thumb. It places a tremendous amount of strain on your wrist and makes looking through the viewfinder a challenge as well. Back to the neck strap for me - it would have been great if it had worked out as planned.
1677,__label1__,"Very few negatives about this machine. I have enjoyed it with my family. I do not feel that it was a bad spend of the money for it. The overall sound quality is good, and it was easy to set up in our den."
1678,__label1__,They work really well. They are the right height and narrow enough that I could squeeze in a couple more people in a pinch. The price is less than half what I had seen other similar looking chairs sell for and they do not require any assembly.
1679,__label1__,This product is an awful waste of money and is generally not worth the effort that you would put into it.
1680,__label1__,"This post has been slightly moderated to satisfy Amazon's rules of posting.<br />This is a smaller overview that will enable people to see more easily what the full PDF is about. It shows why there is a need for a rebuttal. Morgan attacked by book with lies as I can show. Those who then wish to proceed to the full PDF will be welcome. My web site is at PROBITYPRESS.COM.<br />JOHN MORGAN: A FRAUDSTER EXPOSED<br />IF ANYONE WISHES TO ASK QUESTIONS, OR MAKE A STATEMENT, I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO RESPOND TO YOU ALL PERSONALLY.<br />I have written a book called The Princess Diana Conspiracy that has been attacked by a fraudster called John Morgan. Morgan has written a load of rubbish about my book and said there are two hundred errors in it and then expands that onto 500. One of Morgan's team of loyal ""reviewers"", Hiram, has arbitrarily increased that number to 600. It is all an exaggerated corruption.<br />This is a logical way for MI6 to progress their campaign. But they would also like you to read Morgan's rubbish because he espouses corrupt inquest evidence and so supports their purpose. If you fall for it, then Diana will become a fading footnote of history but the monarchy will also be safe for another number of years until it finally succumbs to the inevitable but too late for Diana's justice.<br />To all those souls that demand justice for Diana I ask you to consider the points I make. It will take a little of your time but Diana will benefit from your diligence and be closer to being avenged. You will follow my logic; most will recognize the truth having read this PDF.<br />I place you on my web, just before the PDF.<br />God bless<br />Alan<br /><br />JOHN MORGAN: AN UNPLEASANT BUT NECESSARY REBUTTAL<br />INTRODUCTION<br />An unpleasant task follows; one I cannot sidestep. Someone called John Morgan from Brisbane, Australia has compiled several books about Diana over the last few years taken directly from the Diana inquest transcripts. My book is sellingwell; his aren't selling. He has attacked my book with a criminal, so called, ""review"" that is false so I must put the record straight. Morgan's books are seriously flawed but I must also illustrate his purpose in writing his odious and corrupt little so called ""review"". Here is a free PDF download. I ask that you please make the ultimate judgement.<br />OVERVIEW<br />My book, the Princess Diana Conspiracy, has sold well and convinced many people about Diana being murdered; this hasn't pleased MI6. They tried to prevent my book from reaching the US market by sending my first book shipment back to the UK. Amazon.com was also later persuaded that my book was made of ""hazardous materials""; this prevented it's availability around the time I was on four US TV shows and five US radio shows in September which was a critical time for my book's exposure. I also appeared on the Geraldo at Large show in New York and wasn't told I would be met by Imogen Lloyd Webber (MI6) who tried hard to debunk my views. Now MI6 recruit a failed author to assist them.<br />MI6 use Morgan's services because he is more concerned about money than justice for Diana. He has written several boring, disastrous books and has latched onto ""The Princess Diana Conspiracy"" to advertise them. He wrote his ""review"" based on his flawed opinions, not facts. Despite acknowledging that the inquests evidence is corrupt, he uses this same material to debunk my book and to write all of his own books; it is all he has. How anyone can write an account of what happened to Diana by using this same corrupt evidence and without challenging it, escapes me. MI6 had ten years to sanitize evidence and Morgan's views reflect the inquests findings, thus showing that he supports MI6.<br />I show that a huge number from Morgan's list of my supposed ""errors"" are either complete nonsense, his ignorance of the pre inquest evidence or his own baseless opinions. Morgan suggests his opinionsare indisputable and other ""errors"" are what he calls my ""Power Constructs""; these are where he doesn't accept the evidence I present because he doesn't possess it. All are my supposed ""errors"" and a large number of examples are shown in the PDF. Morgan didn't start looking into the details about this vile crime until 2006. I began in 2003 so I use this pre inquest evidence to challenge the evidence that emerged from the inquest. Morgan perversely extolls the inquest evidence whilst also stating it is corrupt.<br />He attacks me by saying that ""All investigative books-I include my own-have some errors. That is not the issue. The issue here is the level and type of error"". So he pins the justification for his attack not on any errors but on the level and type of my supposed errors that apparently indicate I am working with MI6 (I am not). So, if you are content that the examples I show in the PDF illustrate Morgan's point is rubbish, and you may even regard his comments as pathetic, you will clearly see his purpose.<br />This was not a labour of love but done out of necessity. If we are to have justice and bring the truth to light then I need to clarify Morgan's purpose and send him to your mercy; not of my choice. Please find the time to read the full review on my web and take your own stance. Don't let this man pervert the course of justice now when my book takes us so close. Demand justice for Diana, Princess of Wales and deny MI6 their hard fought for victory.<br />PDF FOLLOWS ON WEB<br /> (I did make mistakes in The Princess Diana Conspiracy and have apologised. But these genuine errors were corrected and published as an eBook three weeks before Morgan's corruption emerged so his pathetic comments about my MI6 association and raising false flags etc., by deliberately giving out false information, are proven untruths; he knew I was pursuing justice. I had already corrected the genuine errors earlier so clearly wasn't trying to laya false trail. Please understand this point because it's the bedrock of Morgan's excuse for his corruption and proves this man is a criminal. I have now finished a review of my entire book and it is being typeset; it will be with the printers next week and also an update will be sent for the eBook. I shall also be extra careful when I send the files to the printers this time to ensure they arrive intact-more later.)"

1682,__label1__,"I've got 2 iPhones and several iPods in the family. Every car has a car charger and every room in the house has an AC charger. As everyone knows, no matter what you do to try and conserve battery life on the iPhone, you inevitably run out of power. Ever since I got the QCell, that problem no longer exists. The QCell is small enough to just throw in your backpack, briefcase, purse, etc and know that you are covered. The charge time to get the phone back to a ""worry-free"" level is quite impressive. Those marathon conference calls that seem to occur when you are away from a power source used to be an issue. The long airline flights where you are playing a game on the iPhone, and even though you are in airplane mode, the battery still doesn't last. Well, with the QCell, both those problems is solved. The led comes in handy too when you are in a bind. The laser pointer is nice too, but I don't think I will ever use it. There are plenty of miniscule laser pointers out there, that are more comfortable and convenient to use."

It took her some time to figure out the cup but she's a pro at it now.Inexpensive replacement valves (I used to poke the valves thru the spikes in the top rack to wash, and wore them out quickly). Great cup! Until... my little beaver decided he likes to gnaw on the spouts."
1685,__label1__,"Nice mug in many ways, but I can't use the lid because when I do, my coffee develops a sort of horrible plastic-y musk within a minute or two. I really dislike the plastic tops. In my opinion the plastic leeches into my hot drinks, giving it a nasty taste. Also the silicone around the cap leaves a nasty taste on the rim of the lid.The lid doesn't smell like anything to me when it's clean / prior to use and I've diligently scrubbed it, so I can only conclude that it's poor-quality plastic that's leaching something into my cup."
1686,__label1__,This really didn't do anything to help my cat's vomiting problem. I saw it works with some reviewers and some didn't. But with me seems like it didn't also. Since they are animals we I don't know how to ask them if did it works?

We are putting it in our office and only using it as overflow when our guest room is full, so hopefully we are just using it for decoration. For the price I was expecting a little more."

1692,__label1__,This is the most elegant watch ever. It looks so manly because it's very large and needs a large wrist to look appropriate. I love it!
1693,__label1__,They have a very strange aftertaste. I dont normaly drink tea but these really taste funny. My wife says they are ok but I still have 1/2 the box sitting in my kitchen for over a year now.
1694,__label1__,"nice, soft rug. but the color is not ivory white (as pictured here), it's more of a yellow ivory color. and there's this really weird smell coming from the rug so I had to air it out a bit."

1698,__label1__,"I used this on a side wall in my kitchen. It gives perfect mood lighting. I used a CFL Bulb, which not only saves money and energy, but doesn't generate heat. I also bought this in the clearance section, and it was in perfect condition, so I saved a lot of money that way."
1699,__label1__,I like this hay... It was fresh.. my rabbit happily had it.<br />I will recommend your products to all of my friends.<br /><br />Thanks for that.
1700,__label1__,"When I purchased this headset, I had been looking for a quality pair for a long time. I had tried time and time again hoping for something that sounded great and was comfortable on my head during gaming or just casual use.<br /><br />Not only was this headset extremely uncomfortable, but the sound quality was horrible. After only a week, one side stopped working and I had to hit it to try to get it to work again. This was absolutely NOT what I expected after looking at the other good reviews. The price was great, but I should still expect to receive something worth actually using...<br /><br />I searched again, asked around and finally found a headset that works now, and I love it! It has been about 2 months and it still works great. I can go hours at a time without them bugging me and the sound quality is AMAZING!<br /><br />If you need a QUALITY headset, take a look at this one here on Amazon --------&#62; http://amzn.to/181sLOx<br /><br />I have never been happier with any other headset and hope you get the same result if you decide to try one!<br /><br />If not, at least I got to share my experience with this headset!"

1702,__label1__,"I'm not a fan of Karaoke but my little niece is nine and thinks she's going to be the next Britney Spears. The little blue Karaoke machine is her favorite pastime. She's been using it since she was almost eight so it is super easy for a child or really anyone to use. The sound isn't bad either as long as you have someone decent on the microphone. It is a favorite for sleep overs and spontaneous moments with friends. If your child or little relatives love to show off and sing, this is a great buy. It keeps them entertained for hours."
1703,__label1__,Actually this is a fault product. Because I use it but I have no change. It give me just zero result. It is very very bad.
1704,__label1__,This ring looks better in picture in person is so thin and diamonds too small looks beautiful but if you have a big fingers I don't recommended I have small fingers and I can barely notice I have it on :(

1706,__label1__,Great looking watch but you better have a really big wrist to wear it. The watch is heavy and the band is stiff.
1707,__label1__,Not as good as expected. Was poor for use as you couldn't switch from one power to another. This is the first product I purchased from you that I wasn't happy with. This was not a good buy for the money. I usually shoot at a 200 yards and this doesn't works.
1708,__label1__,"It is great, remarkably well built for the ridiculously low price I bought it for. Feel more powerful only after about a month of use. I had a screw come off after a couple weeks use but then again it is a small price to pay for how little this thing costs. I put the screw back on along with the nut and I was back in business. If you are looking for a beginner rowing machine, this is it."
1709,__label1__,"I didn't know there was much difference between tennis balls until I tried these Championship XD balls to fill out my shopping basket. These are considerably heavier than the cheapest ones. They're accurate in the wind and have a strong rebound, which is good for wall practice.<br /><br />The reason it didn't get five star is because the first ball cracked open after only about 3 hours of play. I'm not sure if playing in the rain had anything to do with it but it's the only tennis ball I've ever broke so far. The second ball is holding up well however, it's still very firm even after the letters have worn out."
1710,__label1__,"This is an incredibly fun game to play with friends and family. I know because I played it with friends and family. My kids always seem to win though and I always seem to be on the losing end.<br /><br />The game itself is beautifully designed, with the characters and the system being created to provide you with an excellent base to have your fun. You can also make sure to lose no pieces by simply placing them all in the box that has plenty of space."
1711,__label1__,"This one is very unique, but only 4 stars as it is very difficult to figure out the time in the few seconds that it stays lite"

1713,__label1__,"There are some lovely vignettes of expat family life in this compilation, most notable Susan Conley's exploration of hutong culture with her children, Alan Paul's lampoon-ish family adventure in Szechuan, Kay Bratt taking a disabled orphan under her wing, and Kaitlin Solimine's heart-warming homestay experience.<br /><br />But beware: this book lives up to its ""Unsavory"" title with several profane tales which left me shaken rather than stirred: not one but two stories about beatings (Hessler and Humes), an English teacher hitting on his female Chinese assistant (Matthew Muller), Nury Vittachi (a children's book writer for Scholastic no less!) interacting with gangsters and bar girls, Susie Gordon's glamorization of drug use and materialistic extravagance, SEVERAL baijiu (rice liquor) stories celebrating China's binge-drinking culture, and the editor Tom Carter's funny but nonetheless disturbing patronage of prozzies.<br /><br />Fortunately an anthology allows the reader to be selective, and there are a whopping 28 action-packed stories to choose from, so I still feel good about recommending this book to my network of expat families."
1714,__label1__,This is a great coat for the value. I ordered this for my 86 year old mother for the style and because she gets very cold . When she put this on and wore it out last week it was a very cold windy day in Oklahoma and it kept her very warm.
1715,__label1__,I brought these cards on wednesday and they arrived the next day. Great quality cards that dont peel at the edges when you shuffle like so many playing cards do. highly reccomended to all my best ones...!
1716,__label1__,"Works very well, I'm shocked by how fast it sharpeners. The design is different than what i'm use to but I believe it's more effective that way. The charger is a bit short, but a simple USB extender fixed that no problem. It has a low profile and fits nicely on my desk!"
1717,__label1__,This is terrible and not in a way that would have been subtle either. The blatant clashes of interested are so strong here that I wonder how the authors ever managed to agree on having it published. These people should get a grip.
1718,__label1__,Its of a Good value with a decent(not great) sound outcome. If you want ridiculously great metallic sound quality irrespective of its price. Its not worth it go for sennhieser or skull candy.
1719,__label1__,"THis works just fine, but I can't imagine owning this device past 2 years tops. The plasic green parts inside are so flimsy. Usually OXO performs with sturdy products but this one just lacks in every way. C'mon OXO, get it together. Your reputation has suffered in my household because of this crap."
1720,__label1__,I placed it in a very small bathroom and it looks very pretty. It was a little bit difficult to hang.

1722,__label1__,"It feels like it is scratching or cutting my skin. It is way too rough and is actually painful. The tool is a nice concept because it keeps the puff from falling apart like some do, but it is so tightly secured in there, that there is no ""give"" to it and you just drag it all over your skin. I'm going to keep a regular puff in my shower, and only use the ""loofa"" side of this thing. I definitely won't be buying another one!"
1723,__label1__,"I purchased this monitor last month. I saw the great price and decent reviews online and boy do I regret it.<br /><br />It wasn't a few days before this monitor had dead pixels forming before my eyes as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality monitor for the price. Next, the DVI port proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. Sure, I expected sub-perfect quality, but I didn't expect a monitor that is just absolutely un-useable.<br /><br />Returning the monitor was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy! I wish I would have just purchased a quality computer monitor to begin with.<br /><br />After dealing with the return, I purchased a MUCH better monitor and have never been happier with it!<br /><br />If you want a QUALITY monitor, check this one out here on Amazon -------&#62; http://amzn.to/1pfCBGU<br /><br />I currently own it now and have never been HAPPIER! It has a great quality picture and wasn't insanely expensive like some of the other monitors for sale here. Please, save yourself the time and frustration that I put myself through!"

1728,__label1__,It's ok.  Got it with subscribe and save but not planning on re-buying it.  May be okay taste to some but not to me.  At least my grand-kids will finish it off.

1730,__label1__,"Below average sound quality, the sound was crackly and unclear even when directly next to the computer it was attached by Bluetooth.  Either in Bluetooth mode or  using the audio jack, the buzzing noise is very loud. I'm very disappointed with this product. I should have save more and get a something better."
1731,__label1__,"What can I say? I overpaid for this one. $25 was a little much, but I really wanted to try and see what these were all about. I must say that I was impressed, and hope that the price comes down. If under $20 this would be a great deal."
1732,__label1__,"I love the entire Milka chocolate line, but this one is the best. Its taste is so good and unique that makes me dream of it all day long. The only thing that stops me from eating it continuously is the health issues that I have.<br />My only complaint is that it comes only in this size. during my last trip to Europe I found this chocolate packed in a larger pack."
1733,__label1__,"Love the monopod's range, rigidity, and flexibility. If 67 inches is not enough, nothing will suffice. It is one of those necessities that you really don't need to have in life, but because you're with a lot of people, taking front camera pictures becomes difficult. Other than that, this is a very versatile thing to have. If you have money to shell out, this is a good buy."
1734,__label1__,Thought the coils were shot on my truck so replaced with the Motorcrafts. So far so good. I was disappointed to see that the Ford OEM coils are made in China...
1735,__label1__,"I love it but the installation instructions need a lot of improvement. They are virtually non-existent. Still the sound is great, the profile is great and it does everything I wanted it to do and more."

1739,__label1__,Due to persistent acne in my face I was influenced by my co-worker to use it. Too bad it didn't work on me.
1740,__label1__,"I read this book for AMU, I am assuming that no one read the book prior to placing it on our reading list.  Had they read it they would have known it was a snooze fest.  I had more fun watching paint dry.  Most of what she said was simple common sense.  I already knew I was a visual learner, and I am not a huge a reader. To be honest after chapter 3 I gave up.  After week 3 no lessons refer to this book. I am glad they sent it to me free."
1741,__label1__,I am so pleased with my new Jacket that I bought. It is exactly the right size and has all the pockets I need.

1744,__label1__,I received my batteries in just a few days and charged them all. I tested them in my flashlights and they hold their charge just as expected.

1749,__label1__,This is disappointing.  If you have read the Three Sisters trilogy you have read this book basically.  There is so much reused in this book from her other witch series that it was very disappointing.  It was okay to read it just annoyed me that it wasn't a fresh new book really.

1755,__label1__,"The way these are supposed to work is the suction cups grip the window and hold the shade up.  We tested both shades on window glass and the suction cups held for about 2 minutes before giving up.  These come with black suction cups.  We tried moistening the cups with water, they held about 10 seconds.  We tried the last resort, isopropyl alcohol and had similar results to water.  The whole idea is shot when the suction cups don't work.  The shade is well-made and folds up nicely.    Update on 1/27/2015:  Great Customer Service! The company informed me that I might have received an older pair of shades and will re-send a new pair to me.  I will update it after testing the new pair.    Update on 1/30/2015:  Sellers were very good to help us get a screen that works for us.  We now have a working screen and believe the suction cup problem is due to the suction cups being folded over in the package during shipping.  We're all set, thanks to the sellers help."
1756,__label1__,"It is kind of hard to get used to using the mousewheel as a middle button but still a lot easier than with my microsoft mobile mouse that has a smooth mousewheel.

1757,__label1__,"First off, this arrived very quickly! It's a comfortable chair, has a few reclining levels and can hold quite a bit in the storage pocket. The cup holder is small, the size of a soda can, so you're a bit limited in that respect, but otherwise we like it!"

1761,__label1__,"I've been taking this product for the last 4 days.  While I understand that I cannot fully review a product like this in this short amount of time there are some things that I already don't like about it which has me reconsidering this purchase in the first place.  First off all I ordered this via prime 2 day shipping. It took 4 days to arrive.  Strike one.  Secondly, the way this product is already making me feel from this short amount of time really worries me (i.e. irritable at work, easily flying off the handle at people, little things bug me more than usual, etc etc).  Strike two.  Now if these feelings of irritably and aggressiveness translate into a better workout in the gym and better overall gains, I might change my review, but for now other than some extra energy this product is causing me to be pissed off more than anything else"

It's been almost two months and I have yet to have an issue.<br /><br />I bought it here on Amazon ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1qcVVnZ<br /><br />Even if you decide it's not the TV for you, at least you have a heads up about this one!"

A third works great on my 12 Inch telescope as a rough aim sight for the co-ax tracking scope."
1765,__label1__,Waterproof didn't help me out at all becaucse I use in my attic. But I sure appreciate the durability. These are some well made flash lights.
1766,__label1__,"I Love These,They Are So Comfortable And Stylish.These Jeggings Can't Be Beat. The Fabric Is Very Good"
1767,__label1__,"It's a great clock esp with the radio feature, but not as loud as I thought it would be. I still need to set 5-6 alarms every morning to wake up, so it isn't really enough to do the job for a really heavy sleeper."
1768,__label1__,"It's really great to have one of these at home since we are eating rice every morning (specifically, brown rice). I can wash the rice fast and efficiently using this bowl and it even drains the water quickly. I also like that you can actually squeeze it tight so that the water can get out on whatever you'd like to wash. I have tried veggies and fruits as well and I really like this tool, saves me time and energy. like to buy another one for my mom, she would love this."
1769,__label1__,"Excellent glasses, but they are not as small as the description indicates. I'm a 5'9"" woman and these feel a little big on my face, so don't expect these glasses to fit average or petite women very well."
1770,__label1__,"Item as described and did the job, they were great fun to use!! Good customer service too. Bought these for my daughters party. Were simple to put together with little sticky tabs. Did the trick perfectly for the night. Hours of fun at my daughters party, really good value, got my dad to put onto cupboard to make it more stable so it worked really well.  Really fun props. Would recommend this. Great variety. Really sturdy props which I will be able to use again."
1771,__label1__,"Very bad quality. Came apart with the first wash, literally. One hand towel unraveled on one side. All towels shed all over the washer and dryer, completely clogging the lint tray. These towels are good for rags around the house maybe."
1772,__label1__,"I'm sorry, I just didn't get it. Well written but really slow. One of the few books I have ever had to out down. On the upside, this is clearly a fully imagined world. If you liked that sort of stuff you'll like this."
1773,__label1__,I bought these for a glow in the dark Easter egg hunt.  Needless to say we hunted dark eggs in the dark.  They were very hard to break (had my thumbs hurting) and they were not very durable as one busted on my aunt.  You can only see a difference in the broke ones and the unbroken ones when you are in a completely dark room.  Very disappointed in this.  If I try this again I'll have to get bigger eggs and the bracelet glow sticks.
1774,__label1__,"Time will tell, but this is a lot of saw for the money, and since I am only an occasional user, it should last me for many years."
1775,__label1__,i foolishly bought 2 sets of these collars and bought sets quit working one after the other in s span of 3 days. Shame on you for selling these piece of junks!
1776,__label1__,"While I thought these were going to be great, they ended up being less than what I wanted. The quality wasn't as durable and thick as I thought. Having to buy all of the bulbs was bad enough, let alone not being very sturdy. I would think twice about purchasing something like this. There are better options on the market."
1777,__label1__,"This is a nice and easily rechargeable bike tail light. It's incredibly bright. The case has cooling fins for the LED, which is a nice addition.  I also attach it to my dog's collar at night when I let him out. Makes him easier to spot. Has a couple different light settings. The only thing I don't like about it is that the button feels a little bit sticky. Otherwise a great bike light!"
1778,__label1__,I have one of these Supcase cases and it's oddly shaped and uncomfortable to hold. Bulky on the edges especially. I don't know why they keep making the same weird shaped cases every time.
1779,__label1__,Fantastic Product at a very reasonable price... Thanks amazon for timely delivery and always delivering in with good packaging..
1780,__label1__,"The Blue Ray DVD has issues too where the switch sends it a signal that forces it to turn on even though I didn't turn it on. Although this device appears to work well for others, it is device dependant and may not work well with all your devices."
1781,__label1__,"I love the brightness of the light that it gives, but it drains too much power. Overall, it is very great for times that we will experience black outs and very efficient when those times will come."
1782,__label1__,Have used this product several times to fix Openers at my rental houses. Great product with loads of parts for many types of openers.
1783,__label1__,Have received the speakers 4 days before than the expected date.<br />I'm very happy for the service.<br />Tested the speakers and they sound good.
1784,__label1__,"i figured out that this kind of light bulb lessens the electricity consumption, and so i tried it. the light that it is producing is good but i am not still not sure if it does lessen the electricity consumption. i hope it would, have my fingers cross already."
1785,__label1__,"This is affordable and very lightweight. However, it is not strong enough to drill without the usual pre-drill holes."
1786,__label1__,I love this show and I'm so glad i own it on dvd. This is perfect for any time you want a laugh and the family loves it too.
1787,__label1__,My son loved these cups. They came in fun colors.<br /><br />I loved the storage idea of the cups. After use i can stack multiple cups onto one another to take up much less room in the cabinets.<br /><br />They do not leak and have easy handles to hold onto.<br /><br />The one downside is the plastic on the zippy part is not a strong plastic and it does disform when your kid while chew on the lip.
1788,__label1__,"Loved this watch! Nice weight, easy to read digital and analog face. Love the ten year battery. Will be getting the same watch in other colour for my son. A little tricky to set time."
1789,__label1__,"This camera is priced right, looks stylish (just as good as it is in the pictures) and the 16mp is good enough for any casual everyday pictures."
1790,__label1__,The mic on my headset doesn't work on this item!So it just don't work properly!Defective item!I should read the other commends before buy this item!
1791,__label1__,"I love these containers for homemade baby food. They clean easily in the dishwasher, and I have no problems with them in the freezer, refrigerator and microwave. The lids are tight so there is no leaking. The only problem I have is that the gaskets on the lids fall off when washing the containers. Otherwise great buy!"
1792,__label1__,"The Ipod is my constant companion. I have an extremely large and varied music collection, and am adding to it all the time. Battery life is much improved, screen is very bright. The touch-wheel on the new one seems a bit more sensitive. With the increased capacity I can load music at higher bit rates, 192kbs and above."
1793,__label1__,I took this along with Raspberry ketones and neither one of them seemed to have an effect on me. I'll keep it up but I am just not having the luck I had hoped for.
1794,__label1__,"I had high hopes for this product, given the high reviews. However, after three uses, this product has not worked at all. I have followed the instructions to the letter and it has had absolutely no effect. I feel very disappointed, considering that it cost over $."
1795,__label1__,"I replaced my old electric razor with this one, and have been disappointed every since. I have decided to buy the replacement part for my old one."
1796,__label1__,i have not had any success with this product.  it's expensive and it feels good but honestly i don't see a difference.  i don't really see the point of it and now i'm going to try and sell it used.
1797,__label1__,"I really, really want to give the Lego Falcon a five star rating. It is by far my favorite ship in all the Star Wars movies, and the Lego model is a near perfect representation of the ship. Also this was the first big Star Wars Lego set I bought, which in turn brought forth a wonderful second childhood of building the toys I dreamt of as a kid. I've since purchased six other models including the mighty Death Star.<br /><br />It really deserves the highest rating, but personal feelings aside, I can't. Why? Because once constructed, the model is very flimsy. I've read other reviews that bragged about how sturdy it was, and I don't see it. Every time I move it around, I have to be very careful. The side hedges snap out of place quite often and have to be reattached, and the ceiling panels can come off very easily. At one point, the entire cockpit assembly came apart and I had to dig out the instruction booklet to make sure it was properly attached. Honestly, I think this is a really awesome model, but it just doesn't seem sturdy enough for the rough play kids will do with it once built.<br /><br />Okay, now that I said that I can get on to the good stuff.<br /><br />This is really a fun ship to build, and it will take a while. I spent four afternoons working on it, but that's mostly because I like taking my time putting these things together. I suppose an expert builder with the time could put it together in one afternoon.<br /><br />Also, as with the Lego Death Star, which I also reviewed, the detail is amazing, and every single thing featured in the movies is here, from the holographic chess table to Luke's Jedi training ball (even though it`s on the opposite side of the ship). The Luke figure even has a reversible face with the blast shield so he can put on the helmet and train. The tiny details like that are the things that always amaze me about these Lego sets.<br /><br />The inside of the ship is very spacious. You could literally fit a small army of mini-figs inside. I can't help but think the Lego people could have done even more with the inside, but like I said, they already included everything you could think of.<br /><br />Also the mini-fig selection is awesome. You get all the main characters in their classic ""New Hope"" outfits. Though I find the inclusion of Darth Vader a bit odd since he never set foot on the Falcon. I would have liked to see Lando instead, since it was originally his ship and he later piloted it in Han's absence. They could have even put him in his generals outfit from ROTJ, but it's seems as if the Lego people wanted to stick to the characters from ANH.<br /><br />A couple minor complaints before I conclude. As other reviewers have noted, the cockpit is small. With all the room inside the main body of the ship, I think they could have done more here. Same with the gun turret seats in the center of the ship. It's really just a flat panel with some controls attached and can't be accessed from the interior of the ship. It seems more like an after thought.<br /><br />Overall, I hope no one lets my earlier criticism bother them too much. It really is an awesome ship, but I just find it a bit difficult to keep together, and I think that should be noted. In spite of a few flaws, it's still very much worth it."
1798,__label1__,"I bought this to use as a printer stand and it was the exact size and style I wanted. After I assembled it I wished I had also used Liquid nails for more permanent construction but as I won't be moving it around, it'll be fine."
1799,__label1__,I was certainly inspired by the first film to watch this second one. This one is good too; yet not as superb as the first one. The plot is poorer and weak. Anyway can watch without getting board. First film was a unique one; i have never watched anything like it ever in my life. This one is more close to a massacre film. Extreme violence; but that is all.
1800,__label1__,"I got this iPod since my son wanted it for his birthday. It looks almost like my iPhone. However, I find that given the price I think there are a lot of cheaper alternatives out there. So I wouldn't buy it again."
1801,__label1__,This is meant for little dogs that can't jump that high I think. Big ones just leap over it like it was nothing.
1802,__label1__,I wanted a soft case and got this one but i don't like it at all. It looks very cheap and low quality makes my phone look bad. Look for a different one.
1803,__label1__,"Cool and unique ring! My husband put it right on, he liked that he never saw a ring like this before.  It is flexible and he recommends selecting a finger that is within 1-size of the actual ring size for the best fit. The ring fits so comfortably, he forgets he is wearing it.  I purchased this ring at a reduced rate for my review and made my husband so happy."
1804,__label1__,"I bought this gift for my 2 yr old niece whose birthday was very recently. I had no idea what to get her but I did a little searching on amazon and I found a bunch of really great, cute gifts for her age group. This is one of the gifts that I got. We opened it up during her birthday party and played it a bit with her and her friends. They all had such a great time. My sister thanked me and assured me that it is going to get a lot of use in the next fear years."
1805,__label1__,"I just began to watch this season and I'm still not sure if I like it yet... It does seem pretty good, but I think the cast for the most part sounds way to cool and calm. ALWAYS. My attitude may change though... guess I'll figure it out..."
1806,__label1__,"But nope, came and looked fine from the outside, but once opened realized the leg was seriously bent. And there was a dent in the same side. I tried bending it back into installable shape and then the paint started coming off at the bend."
1807,__label1__,"These were really priced right. As some other reviews indicated, they are a tad on the lightweight side but it is something I prefer as opposed to heavyweight athletic type socks. The fit is great and I feel I got a terrific value and a very speedy delivery. I would highly recommend this item for anybody that prefers a medium weight  Sock."
1808,__label1__,"This is an awesome cleaning set, coming with everything that will let you clean your camera, frustration-free. Of course, that's assuming that you know how to clean your camera in the first place."
1809,__label1__,"I really like this scarf! It is so beautiful and comfortable. Yesterday, I and I only wear them today. This material is not difficult, do not sweat the neck, it's just perfect for fall and winter. I would recommend it to anyone, I ordered today. I got the black, it's true colors and lengths, so that you can see in the picture is you. I love I wear so many different wear fact, you can wear or fall. I love it!"
1810,__label1__,"Its ok. When I went to assemble the legs, I found that two of the legs had a wide crack going down the entire side. Luckily, the cracks could face the inside and out of sight. Decided not to send it back- thinking that if the legs do split into two pieces, I can superglue them back together. The top seems to fit a little too tightly to use the tray side without making a huge effort to pull the two pieces apart. I don't think it was worth the money I paid for it, and actually saw it offered at a lower price later on another site."
1811,__label1__,"Just what I was looking for as far as color, material used and wrist size. The reason I returned it was because it was too heavy - really too much weight on my wrist and too large for blouse sleeves - they kept getting caught on it. I was sad that I had to return it."
1812,__label1__,"These earrings were a bit larger than we expected. They look just like the picture with a nice depth to the strong, clear color. This item is a gift that the recipient wills definitely be able to wear everyday."
1813,__label1__,"Ok, after a few bad products, now this is the third wheelchair I have purchased for Gracie, but finally a keeper... it is better than the first two for a few reasons. One thing is that it has a better balance than his k9 cart which the side bars on that cart bent after just a few weeks so I returned it. The other cart was from walkin wheels, it was expensive in price but cheap in design, it never worked well and broke only after a few days... We have been using this BFM cart for 2-months now and it's a good wheelchair, but I have to complain about the tread on the tires has already worn off a good bit. The company actually sent me two new tires for free, but I can only give 4-stars that the tread would wear down so quickly..."
1814,__label1__,This case doesn't even deserve 1 star. The quality is really bad. Nothing like the photos which were obviously photoshopped. The back part scratches way too easily and inner layer looks so cheap. Waste of time and money.
1815,__label1__,"Great pair of classic hoops. Great weight, the clasps are comfortable, however be careful, they are easily undone, and they'll go flying! I wouldn't wear them if you are gonna be doing any sport like activities."
1816,__label1__,"the color isn't good, I hate to see my yard shining weird green tint white light. Not 50 watt equivalent at all, too dim a bulb. 4 bulbs burnt out already. Terrible!"
1817,__label1__,"The dress is with good quqality, thank you. The color is nice. And i like the design of the dress, it is very fit on body, and is very sexy. Thank you."
1818,__label1__,"I love this bedding, only problem was the mobile we received with it was messed up and corroded! Was not happy because now we can't use it or return it. Thought the quality could have been a little bit better. Also, it only came with one window valace, most rooms have two windows do they not?"
1819,__label1__,This is a great little work bench for a toddler. I like it because there are also project instructions and materials included so that an adult can play with their toddler and create a few projects. Nice!
1820,__label1__,"I bought my GT P1000 last year and I was very happy at first. Now that it's more than a year, I get more and more disappointed with it.<br />A month after I bought the item, 2nd gen Galaxy Tabs were released with the same price. At first I didn't feel any regret but then my GT crashes so many times the longer it's in my hands. It keeps turning off for no reason. Sometimes I just compose text and out of nowhere it reboots. Sometimes I don't use it that much then the graphics get all wrecked (I really can't tell what happens exactly but the colors somewhat distort or something) It showed during the first few months I bought it but not too often and would usually go back to normal once I reboot but now it's really becoming annoying.<br />It's also bulky and heavy not like the new ones. I just gave away my GT to my brother after a year because it annoys me too much just looking at it.<br />I liked it when I bought it and thought I made a good investment but I regret having it. I gave it three stars because the specs overall is still good but it doesn't live up to how it should."
1821,__label1__,"My little guy is now 2.5 years old, and these toys have been a bath time companion for the past 6-7 months. He absolutely loves them, and his favorite is the blue one. They are a great size for his small hands."
1822,__label1__,"One of the good TV series in the last 20 years, and worth the price to be able to work your way through the series, episode by episode...I only wish that they had continued the series with Jimmy Smits and his Presidency being the premise."
1823,__label1__,"I love these earrings. I wear them everyday and now my friend wants to buy the same as well, but I won't tell her where I got them from :P. Anyway I really like them and the only downfall was the slow shipping. Otherwise I highly recommend."
1824,__label1__,"This has always been my favorite chocolate. I always gift this during occasions. Love it, but it's starting to get pricey over time."
1825,__label1__,"We love this table.It's sturdy and seems durable, which is good for  teenage boys. I would defiantly recommend this table."
1826,__label1__,These were terrible cartridges! Printer kept giving me error message as if ink were empty after only 5 pages or so. Took them out and cleaned contacts and still would not work. I got a total of about 10 pages out of both black cartridges combined. I have purchased other refurbished cartridges never had problems.
1827,__label1__,"This product serves it's purpose, but isn't very sturdy. I still have some books to put on the lower shelves that I am a bit concerned about it holding the weight. I bought it because the price was right and it is for my home office. I didn't want to buy anything expensive for a room no one hardly sees. If you don't plan on placing all books or very heavy things, it should be fine."
1828,__label1__,"I returned this product twice - the scent was mostly alcohol, which means the testers are either really old or the fragrance somehow separated from its alcohol base, perhaps due to poor storage and/or the hot temperatures....... very disappointing"
1829,__label1__,The ties are very thin. Don't let it touch any hook side of a velcro as it will strip and ruin the tie. Other than that for the price these ties look great.
1830,__label1__,"the exercise bar that i received looks NOTHING to the one that i shown on the image above! i had been waiting for this for days and when i got it, i was disappointed<br />theses people have bad service as they cant even send me the correct exercise bar!"
1831,__label1__,"I had two ferbies when I was growing up and the fact that they're back made me so happy! I am ordering one from my brother and hey i'm a big little kid, so one for myself as well. It seems a lot more advanced then the old Ferbies."
1832,__label1__,"Watch was a little too flashy for me. It wasn't overkill, but it just didn't have the balance of professionalism and flash that I require. I couldn't see myself wearing this with my suits. Maybe my sports coats."
1833,__label1__,"The quality of the chocolate is the best. The variety was good as well for the one I picked. They're delicious and it's very hard for me to stay away from them (because I am dieting and, of course, they're not of much help in this situation)."
1834,__label1__,"I went on a vacation in Guam. It was a relief that I had already purchased these. The hotel had similar items, but they wanted to charge way too much for it. I'm glad I got the three pack. It was handy as I had several electronics to charge."
1835,__label1__,"Excellent size and works like a charm, sadly after the second use the stitching came undone at the end of the velcro fastener I will continue to use it until it completely falls apart. Fair warning...it is not the best made product."
1836,__label1__,Not a good slouchy hat at all. It does not slouch correctly and it seems to be too small. Don't recommend at all.
1837,__label1__,Didn't seem to work at all - in the junk drawer. Buyer beware! I would go with a more advanced way to check your bills.
1838,__label1__,"A nice clean looking fan that works great on a lower ceiling. I am using this fan on an outside porch. I wanted a fan that was clean looking, weather resistant and easy to clean. The integrated 100 watt light works great and can be dimmed to the user's requirements."
1839,__label1__,"Very loud and the foot pedal does not work right, when I press to start sewing it won't go, and when I stop it still wants to run, very aggravating, Got this machine to do my quilting on and it doesn't hardly want to pull fabric thru. Wish I could get money back. Very disappointed."
1840,__label1__,"This thing is dream. Small wheel radius means easy to pedal. I have the single speed, no hills here in beach.. It is a delight to ride. Moves along just fine. I go to the store, cuts down on gas usage and fighting the other drivers (very impatient drivers here)."
1841,__label1__,"A lot of people I know don’t really appreciate the value of onions but I do and I love this, particularly for the advantage in taste!"
1842,__label1__,I absolutely love these leggings they are professional for everyday work and can be dressed down..worn with boots or heels… very sexy ...I have almost all the colors the denim ones are just as great.. ..Since I have been losing weight I have ordered more in my new size the price is just right
1843,__label1__,"The price seemed good and it technically worked, but it still should give you a functioning computer screen.<br /><br />The biggest issue with this is the dead pixels, tons of them appeared fairly quickly and I couldn't figure out why. I also wouldn't call the resolution anything special, I have smaller monitors that have looked better and are a few years older.<br /><br />I dealt with this performance for a little while but had to do something about it before I went crazy.<br /><br />I did some research and found a monitor that is SO much better and hasn't dropped a pixel in over two months, even though I don't expect it to ever.<br /><br />I bought it here on Amazon too ----------&#62; http://amzn.to/SHHmgn<br /><br />It is a great monitor and you won't regret using it. If you don't decide to get it, at least I could point others in the right direction!"
1844,__label1__,I’m taking care of my grandma’s cat now and he’s really old and won’t eat as much solid food now. I have to mush them up just so he doesn’t starve. I wanted this one to work but he didn’t even sniff it.
1845,__label1__,"My little girl loves Frozen and everything to do with it, so this toy was practically a given. But I was barely able to make it work, and even then I felt like it would fall apart easily. Luckily, my daughter knows how to care for her stuff, but this toy still feels pretty cheap for the value it provides."
1846,__label1__,"The mp3 player is fine for what it is and at its price, but I encountered it to drain the battery very fast. As well as problems getting the computer to 'read' it to add songs. Then you have to convert songs into mp3 format to even transfer them onto the device for it to work."
1847,__label1__,"These are good batteries, I like that they are rechargeable because I hate blowing money on new ones! They can get super expensive. These charged up quickly and worked in the items I used them in. I am not sure how long they will last, but I'll make notes and share more once they do die."
1848,__label1__,"I was searched on Amazon for something to keep my iPhone 6+ dry and I found this seller provide greatest price and the picture is the same as other company picture which is higher price. And I sent the link to my friend to purchased my favorite pink color. I was surprised the item delivered very fast. But guess what? Strong CHEMICAL SMELL, immediately I feel like want to vomit!!!… Also IT CAN'T HOLD MY IPHONE 6+ VERTICALLY AS THE PICTURE SHOWN!!! Also No Brand at all, can't see anywhere written CRENOVA. I have 42 inch waist size and this product CAN'T fit me, AGAIN Wrong Description! At last the triple zip lock is not matching each other, they just not fit well and very hard to close, HOW CAN IT BE WATERPROOF!<br />Very disappointed experience with CRENOVA product, I have returned the item. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR."
1849,__label1__,"This seemed like a huge amount of candy at one delivery. However, I pass it along to my chocoholic friends at our social events.<br />Suggestion: During summer, don't forget to put a bar in the freezer for a couple hours before eating."
1850,__label1__,Slather it on to keep yellow jackets from biting (they seem to think I would make a fine meal); works for about an hour. Probably would not stop yellow jackets from stinging if they are annoyed.
1851,__label1__,I honestly haven't used it yet as I am still pregnant. It seems to be areasonable buy so far. The design appears appropriate for a new baby! A word of advice to new moms: avoid the bath tubs with the foam lining it as the foam mildews and is very difficult to keep clean!
1852,__label1__,"I usually have a hard time finding watches that fit my wrist as it is small. This watch fits great. I love the small size, yet the numbers are very visible. I also love the material the band is made of. Many watches roll around my wrist, which is annoying. This watch stays in place and is very comfortable. I'm thinking of ordering a few more."
1853,__label1__,"This bed is great for my 3 year old, he loves it. Downside to it, it was difficult to put together. Some of the pieces don't go together as well as they should! Also you need an extra set of hands for connecting the headboard/footboard. But once it was fully put together I couldn't keep my little boy away from it!"
1854,__label1__,This is a great product. Even though I'm not into games this console made me rethink that. The full immersion concept is a lot if fun. Id recommends this product to anyone who might on the fence about buying it. Buy it from here for their price & excellent customer service.
1855,__label1__,"I started using this glitter spray tonight before my base paint was fully dry. I decided to wait a little longer to apply the glitter. Four hours later I came back to the same bottle of glitter paint and it was clogged and would only shoot paint a few droplets at a time. I had to hold the can three inches away from my project to get the paint on and I could only apply it in globs. What a waste of money. It doesn't matter if you read the instructions, which I did and followed. The tip/applicator is not right for the paint formula."
1856,__label1__,"My suggestion? Don't buy this. It makes all of these rings around the cubes, and it just breaks off in pieces. I've tried it over and over, even using different levels, and still nothing useful."
1857,__label1__,"Maybe it is me, but this thing as stretchy and pliable as it is was, was very tight fitting. Even with plenty of water-based lube it was literally chocking me. The concept and small palm size is great, but they need to make a larger version. I just could not seem to get a comfortable tug from it. I love most of the Doc products, but this one was very tight. It ended up tearing after a few attempts."
1858,__label1__,see its good but difficult in installation so you have to work on it first overall its a good product and the features are very usefull
1859,__label1__,"Easy to set up, great sound for the price. Shipping was fast. I've had the system up and running for about two weeks and I love it. I added two rear speakers to have a surround setup. This is a very loud system for an apartment but you have several ways to control the bass output."
1860,__label1__,"Great movies. If you love 80s horror movies like the evil dead, the lost boys, the return of the living dead, killer klowns from outer space, etc. you will like this. I would almost classify this as a horror comedy. It is just an all around fun movie. Check it out!"
1861,__label1__,My sister ordered these for me. The picture makes them look nicer than they are. The bristles will not hold their sharp point or any useful shape at all.
1862,__label1__,I bought these for my son and he likes using it however he sometimes has problems taking them off since they are hard to get off.
1863,__label1__,"I purchased the Nero sink and get lots of oohs and ahhs over its unique styling. The color is a deep charcoal, but not black. The material seems very durable and hasn't scratched at all yet (2 months). I was a little worried that the texture of the surface (which is about the texture of the inside of an iron skillet) might hold food particles, but that hasn't really been an issue.<br /><br />My only concern is that the guidance on cleaning from the swanstone company pretty much eliminates every cleaner on the market. No bleach and no ammonia? Almost everything has at least one of these. Without either of these, you are pretty much out of choices. That said, I have found a very successful cleaning ritual. I start with  warm water/dish soap/scrubbing sponge and finish with a wipe down with a Mr Clean Magic Eraser and this seems to do a great job. I am a fan of bleach, so I do miss the sense of clean the burning odor of bleach gives, but don;t want to risk hazing up the finish.<br /><br />18 MONTH UPDATE. The finish on this sink remains flawless which I find very impressive. I have found a good cleaning routine as well. I use dish soap (e.g. Dawn) and a scrubbing sponge with very hot water most of the time. If it looks like ti needs a a little extra care, I follow that with a granite cleaner and polish. I go about 3 months between polishing and it still looks like the day I installed it."
1864,__label1__,"Great idea but very poorly executed.<br />We loved the idea of playing Giant Jenga in our backyard but this is not satisfactory.<br />Yeah, the size is ok but it's not really that big.<br />Note this game does not include a storage bag so it's got nowhere to go once it's unpacked.<br />I have now bought another far superior item."
1865,__label1__,"I really do love the fact that I bought this product. I bought it for my husband's birthday and ended up loving them for myself. They are considered ""Unisex"" so their shouldn't be a problem right?? Lol. I think anyone interested in this product, should defently purchase ASAP!!!!"
1866,__label1__,"Great little hand-sized speaker. Great for tunes in the garden, or camping! I liked the size, color and connectivity . But the sound clarity could be better.<br /><br />For a even smaller speaker, consider this<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GUXZE6Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00GUXZE6Q&linkCode=as2&tag=derdigki-20&linkId=CDEXOMEUMACNL2JU"
1867,__label1__,"Just received my retractable dog leash. It definitely feels like a quality product. True to its description, you can notice the terrific thought and detail that went into designing the comfortable and ergonomic handle."
1868,__label1__,"I don't like how it looks. It looks so disgusting. but my cat loves it. Moyi because fat after taking this and I think she love it so much. She can finish a bowl even for few seconds. I won't be surprised of she became so fat. I would really laugh to see her having  a hard time walking. Now, she would be like me. Oh, I am just kidding. I don't want her to be so fat. But I won't stop feeding her this because she loves it, again."
1869,__label1__,Kind of a snob about the practice balls that I use. Macgregors are top notch. Have used them for years and will use them for years.
1870,__label1__,I use this for home brewing beer. Easy setup and works great! Delivered more than enough BTU to bring 4 gallons quickly to a boil. Regulator control is very responsive and smooth.
1871,__label1__,Not what this claims.  I sure don't think these are no 1500.  I would look elsewhere if that is what you are looking for.
1872,__label1__,"The drill performs great. long lasting battery life, quick charging time. ONLY problem i have found is that the chuck doesn't tighten enough. Every once in a while the chuck will loosen and my drill bit holder will fall out. No matter how much i try to tighten it. Did i get a defective one? anyone else having this problem?"
1873,__label1__,"I really enjoyed watching this movie with my daughter. We loved the costumes and creativity put into classic fable to make it interesting for younger generation. Overall, wonderful, even though not very traditional movie."
1874,__label1__,I am training my little boy to be more sporty. Good thing I saw this online so I though this would be a big help for him and yes indeed this was a big help. I just hope that this thing would be more durable and sturdy.
1875,__label1__,"I was expecting much on this , cause we have lots if deer passing on the road here in our place and their in group. I was excited to try this ,but the deer never bother. nothing happened putting this in the car, never expect this us only how it look in real."
1876,__label1__,The battery is no longer charging. I have owned it for a few weeks and during that time it worked fine. The second battery is insecurely held in the slot and the lowest part of the battery holder has separated from the whole case.
1877,__label1__,We have two black Labs and spoil them rotten in every way. I thought I'd give these snacks a try as a change. I knew upon opening the bag and seeing and smelling the fake bacon kind of odor that these strips gave off that our babies would not be impressed.
1878,__label1__,Not at all the computer I wanted. It preforms really slowly and the convertible function is not user friendly. I am very let down and plan to get a different computer soon.
1879,__label1__,It would have been nice to have one that would have not let my shampoo leak all over the inside of the bag! I will now have to take out one of the pouches and replace it with a bag that is waterproof.
1880,__label1__,I ordered this for my five year old son but ended up being too complicated for him. I tried playing it with my husband though a few days after and we had a blast. It's a challenge just setting up the structures and the pleasure of ruining what he so painstakingly put up is a gameplay not available in the original game. That is why I'm giving it a four.
1881,__label1__,"When I purchased this headset, I had been looking for a quality pair for a long time. I had tried time and time again hoping for something that sounded great and was comfortable on my head during gaming or just casual use.<br /><br />Not only was this headset extremely uncomfortable, but the sound quality was horrible. After only a week, one side stopped working and I had to hit it to try to get it to work again. This was absolutely NOT what I expected after looking at the other good reviews.<br /><br />I searched again, asked around and finally found a headset that works now, and I love it! It has been about 2 months and it still works great. I can go hours at a time without them bugging me and the sound quality is AMAZING!<br /><br />If you need a QUALITY headset, go here ------&#62; http://amzn.to/1oZcc2j<br /><br />I promise, they are well worth what they cost. You cannot beat quality!!!"
1882,__label1__,These boots are great. Got them for hiking the outdoors as well as for use at work. Would recommend them to a friend for sure.
1883,__label1__,"This ripped before I could even get it on my mattress, zipper fell apart. This is the second time I have bought this brand of allergy cover, the other for my pillow, same thing, ripped before I even got it on my pillow. Very poor quality. Don't bother with it."
1884,__label1__,"I ended up using a heavier construction HDMI cable that came with my equipment, but this one would have done the job. Wouldn't use in a situation where the cable is frequently moved or stressed."
1885,__label1__,This helmet was lightweight and fits me well but took a long time to get to my house. Would buy again if shipping was faster
1886,__label1__,after few weeks of installing my screen protector.. the lower part is starting to peel off. :( after few days it was all gone.
1887,__label1__,I love eating them and they are good for watching TV and looking at movies! It is not too sweet. I like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so I can take my time eating them.
1888,__label1__,These are a most comfortable work type shoe that you can wear anywhere.... quality and looks great. The shoe is roomy inside and cushy..overall excellent!
1889,__label1__,"Yes, I purchased this playstation move bundle for my son in law and it is the best gift I could have bought it is awesome, and so much fun .I would recommend to everyonethank you for a great giftsherrie"
1890,__label1__,"Tried the product twice a day for the whole filling of the unit, but did not see any results to call some progress. Sorry to say so! I can apply this without doing a juggling act, thanks!!"
1891,__label1__,Great product for the price. The stitching was poor as thread was pulled out in many locations. After further inspection it seems to be excess stitching that was never trimmed. Looked worse than it was.
1892,__label1__,These are yummy!! If you have to watch sugar these are great for a little something sweet. They are so much better then the sugar free hard candies I used to get years ago. If you didn't read the wrapper you would never know it was sugar free. Very good!!!
1893,__label1__,When I tried it on my phone it didn't fit quite well. I have to take it off and put on my old one back.
1894,__label1__,"You will need speakers for sure for this TV. I had to return it, just did not work for my needs. And it was for my kitchen and it still wasn't of good quality enough. Order this for an on-suite bathroom in a small space or a small home-office."
1895,__label1__,My wife first got a pair of these golf shoes and was bragging how light they were. I have trouble with my feet so thought I would try them out. They are as light and comfortable as she said. I may even buy another pair.
1896,__label1__,"Stability balls are, well, stability balls. What makes this one different is it has a little sand in the bottom so the ball does not roll away when you get up. This is a simple and low cost modification does give it an edge over those that do not."
1897,__label1__,Ok this is one of those products you get what you pay for. They quality is awful so don't waste your money.
1898,__label1__,"Its light weight and easy setup. Had problem initially but used another laptop and installed fine. Picture quality is not so great but it works. Audio has some echo but could be my living room. Overall, not bad for 50 bucks."
1899,__label1__,"While you take a chance with any print cartridge, unfortunately these HP cartridges were rejected by my printer as &#34;defective&#34; so that I had to return them.  I did get one of the black to work, and it seemed under filled, but it could again have been that our printer did not like the cartridge."
1900,__label1__,"I've tried many organizers, some were so poorly made that I threw them out after a couple days. This one is very solidly made and I'd definitely recommend it."
1901,__label1__,"Worst experience I ever had buying HP Envy M6 laptop from this seller.<br />System was labelled  ""used - very good"" but after I received it, I discovered that 2 USB ports are damaged, the finger print device is not working, the factory installed windows wiped off and replaced with a useless windows 8 OS. 4 indicators light do not light on the system and the system is obviously have been opened before it was sold to me.<br />I urge Amazon buyers to stay away from this seller. He has been cheated me!"
1902,__label1__,We tried several other devices before hearing about this one from our Comcast technician. The trouble with the other devices was that our neighbors could change our channels while we sat helplessly watching them commandeer our TV.
1903,__label1__,"Excellent Build Quality, Packing and feel..!! Premium Style..!! who so ever saw it on my wrist asked me about it...!! What more can I say? Go for it without thinking..!!"
1904,__label1__,"I dont know why, but these switches just dont last long. Now my backup lights dont work after replacing this just a few months ago..."
1905,__label1__,"This is a brilliant and sturdy bounce rope to use for working out. It lives up to expectations extremely well, and I utilize it while preparing and practicing so I can be more fit. It is certainly justified regardless of each penny and it will last you a while. It is made out of good material too. I would rate 4/5 stars"
1906,__label1__,These nuts were not what I expected. The can had mostly almonds and cashews. There were very few other nuts in the can. I was disappointed because most of the other items that I have purchased were very satisfactory.
1907,__label1__,Got covered with scratches on the very first day so much that it looks nasty on the second day . The item looks very different than photos. Plastic looks cheap and has a lot of imperfections. It's a waste of time and money.
1908,__label1__,"Just when you think you can never get enough information... read<br />this if you have scoliosis. It's an easy read and well organized for<br />""quick look-ups""."
1909,__label1__,This key ring is very useful. The design is so simple but has a strong presence.<br />Now I can have a multi-tool anytime!. The best part of this is the LED flashlight. Great for my keys.
1910,__label1__,"If only the straps doesn't rip off that fast I would have given a perfect score. But the bag was extraordinary, I carried a lot with this and I only see a little torn."
1911,__label1__,"This chair looks great; it is not real leather so it doesn't look all worn out after awhile. It is on the smaller side of recliners, but works for us. It's not extremely cheaply made, but it is not high end either. It is easy to put together and reclines well. Overall we are pleased and ours sits on carpet."
1912,__label1__,I don't get paid until I can find a person so I need practical and legal means to find a person with a way to verify. So many of the ways in this book are some I already use but I did learn a few new tricks and all of the online resources listed in here I'd never heard of before. I have more than 12 years experience as a small collection agency owner.
1913,__label1__,"The bag looks great and the material/zippers, etc. appear to be good quality. The only issue I have is that the retractable handle is a bit too short. I am not tall (5'7&#34;), and I have to bend over slightly to pull it along. If the handle were about 3 inches longer, it would have been perfect."
1914,__label1__,"Very heavy, cleaner lever doesn't activate easily & doesn't clean the carpet at all!! Haven't tried it on the kitchen floor yet but carpet results don't leave me optimistic for the hard surface either"
1915,__label1__,If you really love writing... and I mean really! You will like this pen. It was a gift to me so I did not have to shell out the bucks for it. But it is the nicest pen I have ever owned. It writes like an amazing instrument. Not your standard BIC pen!
1916,__label1__,"So, this iPad Dock was the last thing I ever thought I would use as much as I do, but once I got started saving songs on my iPad, really a lot of them, and found out I could hook it right up to my stereo, I was in a different world. Now my iPad sits on my desk at the office, and pipes right into my little stereo there so my office is always filled with nice, easy listening music. I'd play Rock-n-roll, but office politics say ""no harsh music"". But the music I listen to are my favorite easy tunes, right off the iPad through this Dock."
1917,__label1__,These speakers have been out on my balcony for a few weeks. They were working until yesterday. Now they only make a plopping sound.
1918,__label1__,This is by so far the best phone. Great sound quality. Good tone and very easy to use.  Nice features
1919,__label1__,"It was okay. I was pleased to see that the video wasn't boring and the people on it didn't seem like robots like most exercise videos I have tried. The music was good as well. The DVD itself was very inspirational, I just think it's more than I am ready to commit to. So, I am taking points off for that. t contains 24 exercises that work on your shoulders, abs, obliques, legs, and glutes. I have no doubt that the program works, but it has to be something you're committed to. It's not something you can do for like 5 minutes a day and end up with a dancer's body. It's a satisfying, total body workout. A friend of mine used the system and she's looking amazing. I just don't have the discipline. So, if you're dedicated, then I'm sure you will look great. If it's a half-hearted attempt then there's probably another option."
1920,__label1__,"I love this small piece, the reason I gave 3-star is the quality of the plug is poor, sometimes it works, sometimes no...Maybe this is exception, I had to return it..."
1921,__label1__,We purchased one shade at 48 by 64 inches and two shades at 36 by 64 inches for a total of $100.00. These shades are VERY similar to the more expensive shades we've been shown. With the exception of the sizing and installation we honestly cannot see or tell any difference at all.
1922,__label1__,"I am eager to achieve my goal.<br />What goal?<br />My goal is to become sexy.<br />I'm 29 years old and still, I don't have a boyfriend.<br />I'm beautiful. I could say that with full conviction.<br />The only problem is I'm chubby.<br />I bought these dumbbells to make my arms thinner and muscle-toned.<br />It works, though.<br />The dumbbells succeeded my quality check."
1923,__label1__,"It's not easily cleaned and can easily become gross from the type of toy it is. Also, the noise that it did make was sub-standard. I was very disappointed in this product as M&D items are usually fantastic."
1924,__label1__,"I had to purchase this matches because I me and my friends are planing to go mountain hiking and, i think that having this matches would be a bright idea. I tried to light-up some matches and they did work, even when wet but not as well as the expensive brands but this will do..."
1925,__label1__,"The plastic is hard enough to actually last, unlike many of these toys with too flimsy of material. I will admit, we parents want to play with these too..."
1926,__label1__,"Every year, I'm buying school bags for my son.<br />I bought this school bag for a year and half but it could still carry the books of my son.<br />I don't have to buy another one to lessen my expenses.<br />My son is not complaining about his bag anymore."
1927,__label1__,it was awesome buying it because my two year old son cant get away without it he really love this car lift toy.
1928,__label1__,"A few months ago I had just gotten the PS4 and wanted a quality headset to go with it.<br /><br />My old headset was comfortable and worked well, I loved the bass you could hear with them but they weren't cutting it anymore.<br /><br />When I tried these I was definitely unhappy... The speakers would make an unbearable noise that sounded like rattling most of the time, even at lower volumes. If this wasn't bad enough, one speaker kept cutting out. I had to bang on the side to get it to start working again.<br /><br />All in all, I didn't enjoy these and can't imagine why they are charging so much for them.<br /><br />After this depressing experience I did some serious research and found a headset I absolutely LOVE.<br /><br />It's been over a month and I can't find anything to complain about. The sound and bass is great and I can wear them for hours on end without any discomfort.<br /><br />I got them on Amazon actually -------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1wbUoC2<br /><br />Even if they aren't the ones for you, I hope I could help share my story with this pair."
1929,__label1__,"Our group got this and a bunch of other snack items for a party and we're talking about people who would eat absolutely anything. When they finally got to this, absolutely no one liked it. Out of all the chips and chocolate bars, this was the only item to have been left barely touched."
1930,__label1__,This watch is very loud and prod. I never thought it would be quiet that bring. It is ok just not the nice orange color I was hoping for. Face is a bit big as well.
1931,__label1__,"The Super Mario brother sounds like a cool game! I played and played, and enjoyed it! What I Like: great fun levels!!What I don't like: Game too short and simple..Overall game is really amazing, and i think you should buy it!"
1932,__label1__,Do not waste your money on this catsuit since you will get why you paid for. The suit is made of a plastic like material and has NO stretch to it at all. This looks NOTHING like the photo at all. Save your time and money.
1933,__label1__,"It was difficult to use. The neck part was uncomfortable. When it arrived the wheel that holds the tension coil was broken. I called the company as instructed and they did not have a replacement part. They said they were going to send out a whole new unit, but, I have yet to receive it."
1934,__label1__,"I have been exercising more and more, and tracking my progress is fun. This is better than the fit bit. I tried my friends fit bit but I liked this one better."
1935,__label1__,"Where should i start! The idea is good but the finished product misses the mark. The rhinestones are stamped on, mine our on a curve. I paid over ten dollars for expedited shipping, it got held up.<br /><br />They graciously credited my account for shipping. They also credited me six dollars since the stones are not lined up straight. I guess i am supposed to be happy... I do not like buying merchandise that in time i may or may not like. Generally, time does not improve my feelings for a product."
1936,__label1__,I thought that it was working at first but it turned out to be a lousy idea. The group just flicked their ears at me.
1937,__label1__,"no one would ever know this isnt leather. it is a large bag, almost a tote size. nice brown, and very roomy. can carry on shoulder or by the straps. love it and especially at such a bargain price !"
1938,__label1__,I own many watches and this one does not disappoint. The picture does not truly capture the beauty of this time piece. The weight is good and looks good on the wrist. The only downside is that it is nearly impossible to read the date.
1939,__label1__,"Because I have specific requirements earrings one pair of blue flowers. I think it looks a bit small, and when they arrived, but I have to say they were perfect for me, most importantly, I love them."
1940,__label1__,"I was expecting very much from this laptop, having in mind the fact tat its price is not what you could call cheap. Unfortunately, it is build of cheap materials and it is very slow. From time to time I work with Photoshop. I am not a Power User, therefore I don't need a powerful workstation for this application. My old Dell was doing a very good job here. But this new HP Folio is a disaster: it takes forever to load the app and each operation I make in Photoshop is extremely slow.<br />Cannot recommend this product."
1941,__label1__,This is a product that really comes to hand when you are travelling or even when you depend on your cellphone. IU just hate to keep my phone on the charger for long because I really use it all the time. Having spare batteries was a must have for me and that is why I got this one here. I love it.
1942,__label1__,I just finished this book. I missed an event I was supposed to attend because I couldn't put it down. It is a well-written
1943,__label1__,Bought one for each dog. The dogs seem to like it alot. So far the canvas has stood up to the scratching from trying to make a nest. It didn't quite fit together so it is a little off balance.
1944,__label1__,"These are great, they taste great and they are super handy when you are on the go with baby, buy the spoons that go with it and you've got messy free lunch on the fly and they are organic!"
1945,__label1__,"Product is as described, at a reasonable price, however we were unable to connect camera to server for web viewing. Support advises customers are unable to connect if you have net service."
1946,__label1__,It fits my Samsung Galaxy S3 properly and Buttons spacing also aligned with the buttons. It sticks very well. Have good colour. It is cost effective and you can buy it in lower prices.
1947,__label1__,"The pump is a little smaller than I expected and yet gives a jet of water about the same size from a solar battery. The only problem there are some glue on the back.And if it had a storage battery  that would be best,so that we could have the fountain work  in the evenings."
1948,__label1__,"This product is a definite yum for me, so I would have to give it all five stars to encourage others to have the same excellent experience."
1949,__label1__,"This product really worked and was surprisingly easy to use. After researching online, I discovered that MMD's method for testing was identical to the experts.. I was quoted about 5 times as much to have someone come to my house and conduct the same testing. The report I got back from My Mold Detective was very easy to understand, too. I sent off the samples to the lab and waited three days to get results which was shorter than the local IEP's turn around time that I was quoted... I guess a week or ten days is the norm... But, sending off the samples was explained on the packaging and I double checked on the website. I rate this product 4.5 stars"
1950,__label1__,"I can't believe this Piece of JUNK (cleaned up for publication) is STILL being sold.  I got one after seeing it at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas (Jan. 2014).  Thought it was a great idea until I tried to get it to work.  IT WOULDN'T.  I contacted their so-called customer service who promised to send me complete instructions.  I waited, and waited.  I contacted them again.  NOTHING.  I packed up the unit and found I couldn't return it BECAUSE...they took too long to get back to me and the 30-day return window had closed.  I took SKYBELL with me this year (Jan 2015) to CES to give it back to these people IN PERSON with a few well-chosen comments...and guess what??  They didn't appear at CES this year.  If you got this POJ to work, congrats.  For me, it's a $200 mistake."
1951,__label1__,"I bought this boot less than four months ago. I am retired but work out side as I see fit. The fit was great and I loved the comfort, until the toe got a hole worn in it just from kneeling in the garden and occasionally on the wooden floor on which I was working."
1952,__label1__,"was a gift to one of my clients who owns a little dog, he and his family liked it. I don't yet own a dog but am looking forward to buying a Poodle by the end of the year and see practically how this product functions."
1953,__label1__,"I purchased this product a little over 5 months ago and hardly noticed a difference... Some people that purchase weight loss items continue with their unhealthy lifestyle while using the product, but I did not. After losing a close family member to weight related issues last year, I decided to change my life for the better.<br /><br />I purchased the Special K Shakes after hearing great reviews from others online and in my community. I fully trusted their opinions and had high hopes for this product. I purchased it and hoped that within a few weeks, paired with an active lifestyle, that I would notice some sort of results. Two weeks passed, three, four and even six weeks later I hadn't even lost 5 pounds! If you have struggled with weight like I have, you can understand how frustrating this can be. After my experience, I really question the good reviews this product has, I have no idea how people believe this product works in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />So naturally, what did I do? I decided I had to find something else that worked. I wasn't going to let the failure of this product keep me from reaching my goal of losing 50 lbs. I searched and searched, did my due diligence and finally settled on a product that I believed gave me the best chance of reaching my goal.<br /><br />It has been three months and I have lost 42 pounds since giving up on the Special K Shakes and I don't regret it! I'm going to reach my goal well before the end of the month and I couldn't be happier! I have never felt so good and relieved in my life. I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long trying so many different products to still be unhappy and overweight.<br /><br />If you have went through the same emotional toll I have and need something that will get you results you need, USE THIS PRODUCT -----&#62; http://amzn.to/1kIihbC. It is available here on Amazon and will change your life, I promise.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed. I am a walking and living example of the fact that this product works and helped me through the hardest time of my life. I hope this helps at least a few people who have struggled with weight throughout their lives."
1954,__label1__,I would have expected a bit higher quality in the packaging of this.  I don't really think this particular one is worth anything extra.  Not sure what they where thinking when producing this.  Note this doesn't refer to the movies themselves.
1955,__label1__,"The Design & Drill driver still struggles on bolts that have been tightened too snuggly, but these fasteners aren't ""tight"" in the adult sense of the world an some simple finger manipulation will easily break them free."
1956,__label1__,"I received a malfunctioned case :/. Once I got it, I saw that padlock protectors were broken together with padlocks - which is an utterly disappointing experience. To make things worst, the case was too small for my pelican even though in the description, it said that it could fit most of them.<br /><br />I returned the item and I bought a Pelican 1650 (http://amzn.to/13zGr7a) which is much safer and harder to lockpick. It had additional place for camera, so I was pretty satisfied."
1957,__label1__,"My dog won’t even go near it. It’s like that time I spilled bleach. He scampered right out of the room. After reading the reviews, it might have been for the best."
1958,__label1__,I brought it in the shower once and now it doesnt work anymore it goes but its stuck in place. It kinda sucks because i actually liked it. It sucks because you cant read any of the instructions or the box since its in jappanesse and i cant call and ask for a replacement or anything because the number on the site doesnt work.

As for the colors, yes, they are a little more pink and somewhat purple than the picture shows, but still very nice. I am baffled as to why they aren't shipped with any padding in between the coasters (they are just in a box). A couple of them have small chips, but not enough to go through the hassle of sending them back."
1960,__label2__,"Originally found them on our Disney Cruise honeymoon. But thought I could pick them up at Downtown Disney later in our trip. Well, I was wrong, which led to me searching high and low.  I found them on Amazon.  I love them.  I am wearing them on our one year anniversary this year!!!<br /><br />Every bride should have a pair!"
1961,__label2__,"These are the most beautifully colored beads!  The two tone beads are fuchsia and lemon with hues of pinks because of an ombre effect.  They have a lovely shine from the Czech Fire Polish.  These beads are on the smaller side (6mm), and there are 25 beads in an order.  High quality, beautiful beads....I recommend them."
1962,__label2__,Similar problem to earlier reviewer.  The control triggered the protection circuit in two of my amplifiers.  One of which I had to take to a service center to get reset.  Not sure whether it was a rogue unit or what.

1964,__label2__,"This is a nice sound bar for the money.  It is very easy to set up, and has 3 HDMI inputs for your added convenience.  It comes in an attractive glossy black finish.  The sound quality is very nice, and the bass is incredible.  However, I have trouble hearing dialog when watching movies unless I turn the volume very high.  When you are using this on low volume, you can only hear the sound effects, and it is very difficult to hear the dialog.  I tried many different settings, but still have same problems.  However, when I blast it, it sounds great.  Very movie like quality.  It works especially great when I am playing games on the PS3.  I get so much bass and it sounds incredible.    If you have a smaller room, this sound bar will fill your room nicely.  It doesn't really replicate surround sound very well, but good enough to get a better movie experience.  You do have a lot of wires when connecting this.  There are about 6 speaker wires and then you have the HDMI in and out and power cord.  I guess we are just so spoiled with this day and age of wireless.    It does not come with any HDMI cables, so make sure you buy some before you install this.  All in all, for the money, it is worth it."
1965,__label2__,"My audio/visual connections are usually nothing short of chaotic, but this RCA Y-adapter has made my life much easier.  My cable box has only one RCA-style audio output, but now I can listen to high quality sound from this one output on both my TV and through my stereo system.  An inexpensive little adapter doubled my listening pleasure."
1966,__label2__,"Personally I did not care for this camera when combined with my compatible Panasonic TV. Quite simply the quality was terrible. I stream other video content on my TV but when talking to my brother in Japan, the video quality was just terrible. I realize this is more a function of the TV, not the camera, but since there's so few models it works with, and I am not about to go out and buy another TV to try it with, this is a big consideration.<br /><br />I also didn't like the wide screen view it uses at all. Great I guess if you have a big family, but my couch is at a distance that I end up being barely visible to the caller. I didn't see an easy way to zoom in or adjust the angle when I am sitting on the floor for instance.<br /><br />Overall, it just didn't give me any benefits over using Skype on my iMac or iPad or iPhone, etc. Really the only reason I guess you would get this is if you routinely want to make calls with a large number of people on one camera."
1967,__label2__,"I've used plenty of winged corkscrews in the past, and they're usually somewhat flimsy, need to be pulled on a lot, and the letral stress form the twisting motion you have to apply to get the cork out eventually breaks the corkscrew. This one is solid. While I can't claim I've used it enough to see if it stands the test of time, the cork comes out much easier, and the whole unit is built very solidly. It also fits snugly on the top of the wine bottle, and the screw is long enough that it pulls the cork out the whole way the first time so I don't have to apply any lateral pressure. If you want a winged corkscrew, this is the way to go."

1972,__label2__,"This is not a sensational account of the ax-murder of eight innocent people in the town of Villisca, Iowa, in 1912. If you are looking for lurid graphics, you'll have to look elsewhere. This is more the story of a typical, turn-of-the-century rural town.<br /><br />Villisca was a Thornton Wilder ""Our Town"" of a place, but one whose gentle clickety-clack through time got derailed by a bizarre murder. The town's railroad and its comfortingly scheduled passings indeed set the tone for this sober account. However, the train might also have been instrumental in delivering a killer to the Moores' doorstep one dark night.<br /><br />It's strange how some murders, like the Lizzie Borden ax-murders, remain in our collective memory and even become part of our vernacular, our common pool of referenced happenings. Meanwhile, other much more shocking and mysterious murders, such as this one, are forgotten by everyone except local people. Some of the film's commentators speculate on such disparities in sustained interest. This documentary brings the tragedy of Villisca out of the shadows, but in the context of the town's larger life.<br /><br />A number of Villisca locals, children at the time of the murders, appear in this documentary, filmed through the 1990's and early 2000's. These elders give first-hand accounts of the days preceding the murders - and the whirlwind of days that followed it. They talk about the heightened suspicion and prejudice that infected the town, reinforcing laws against members of minority groups being allowed to stay there overnight. They talk about the sequence of people who were suspected of the crime.<br /><br />The killings had some distinctive ritualistic, sexual aspects. So the town's primary suspicions might seem ludicrously misguided to us today. We've been well-informed by CSI shows about the likely psychological profile of such a killer - and that profile hardly fit the man upon whom the town settled their conviction of guilt for a while. It's also hard to understand why a series of similar killings in other towns eventually came to be deemed irrelevant to the Villisca case. However, the elders who appear here tell about the business rivalries and the illicit romances that were tacit common knowledge in 1912 Villisca - and which then got hung out on the clothes lines as what seemed like obvious motives for murder after the fact.<br /><br />These first-hand accounts and the accounts of researchers are generously interspersed with sepia photographs of that 1912 time and place. ""Villisca"" becomes reminiscent of a Ken Burns documentary.<br /><br />There are a lot of good extras on this DVD.  These include two excellent commentaries. The commentary by local researcher-historian Edgar Epperly provides an especially literate, evocative accompaniment to a crime that is at once so far-removed from us, and yet so affecting. This is an intelligent, absorbing film on all levels."
1973,__label2__,"Used this for a ceiling for my porch.  Stained lightly it looks great.  Good value for the money.<br />The wood was fairly well packaged -- ends reinforced.  Yet even still we had about 3-4 boards in each box that were unusable because the wood had flaws, or the tongue/groove was damaged in shipping.  Didn't end up hurting us, but keep it in mind that you should get extra if you can.<br /><br />At the end of the day the porch looks great."
1974,__label2__,Well never a issue with any of the cables I tested.  My only advice is if you use a coated cable rub with light grit sandpaper or emory cloth the area that will get cinched down by the locking screw.  Got this advice on a bike forum that has held true.  Great cable and should do one fine for the job.
1975,__label2__,"I wanted this to add to my collection because of the reputation of Ron Lake.  It is not what I anticipated getting.  It is cool looking, a very handsome bit of knife engineering.  However, I could barely open the blade using two hands.  As far as using the thumb assists...that was impossible.  I tried the suggestion of pushing the thumb pieces ""straight up"", but nothing budged.  There are many other knives made by Coast and Ron Lake that must be better.  As a rapid response blade-assist knife...NOPE...NOPE...NOPE~"

I've noticed some people complaining about the online templates, but I haven't found this to be a problem. I found the templates were easy to navigate and I had good results printing from the Avery website.<br />The labels themselves come out looking very crisp and professional. The quick peel backing makes it very easy to remove the labels, and I've had good results with the adhesive sticking to plastic and metal."

1983,__label2__,"Disclaimer: I didn't purchase these at Amazon, I review products not sellers - unless reviewing in a sellers' area.<br /><br />I saw a basket of these at the local Red Apple Store in Toledo, WA. I was visiting there with family over the Christmas vacation. They were $0.99 a for a single serving bag and I thought they look cool so I picked up one. They weren't bad, but they weren't what they claim either.<br /><br />They didn't taste like &#34;Birthday Cake.&#34; When I think of birthday cake I think of a chocolate or vanilla cake with thick whipped frosting and sugar sprinkles. I expect a vanilla and cream or chocolate and cream taste. However, all I got was the chocolate. They did taste like chocolate cake, I will give them that, but not like a chocolate birthday cake. They are larger than other MMs, and I'm not sure why. I really hope that MMs continues that flavor next year, but that they call it something more suitable like Chocolate Cake, Cake, or Brownie flavor instead.<br /><br />Positives<br /><br />-Larger Than  Normal<br />-Chocolate Cake Taste<br /><br />Negatives<br />-No Frosting Taste<br />-Go Stale Faster Than Others (learned the hard way)<br /><br />I would suggest that you only purchase these if you simply want a large or more chocolate MM not a birthday cake flavored one."

1989,__label2__,"This lightweight travel duffel bag from BAGO was an instant hit in our household. Our daughter grabbed it as soon as it arrived, unpacked and unfolded it, stuffed in some of her clean laundry (she was home from college and brought laundry home to wash...) and packed the bag into her car to take back with her.<br /><br />This folded bag is so deceiving -- it truly folds up into a pouch about 11 inches square, and just under 3 inches thick... but it unfolds into a bag that is about 27 inches long, 12 inches wide and about 15 inches deep. Excellent size for a sports or gym bag, or even for carrying two weeks worth of laundry!<br /><br />Both the handles and the shoulder strap are easy and comfortable to use, and the zipper is decent quality.<br /><br />The Amazon listing states that this duffel bag is covered by the following warranty ""If you are not 100% satisfied with the duffel - Simply Return It For A Full Refund !... which seems to be an outstanding commitment to customer satisfaction. If an issue ever occurs I would return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. We did receive this duffel bag gratis from the seller and our daughter put it to use to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.<br /><br />We found this duffel bag to be better than expected, nicely stylish, affordable and quite roomy. If you are looking for a lightweight bag for your on the go needs, for use as I have described above, then our daughter would recommend giving this bag from BAGO a try based on her experience with it.<br /><br />Very recommended.<br /><br />Go for it."
1990,__label2__,"I am using this in conjunction with the Petunia facial serum (I also reviewed). Use it under eye area and around eyes. I don't use it on browbone area (but that's just me, perhaps). This is light, has a pleasant faint fragrance and is silky smooth. The ONLY thing I will note is that you have to be very careful not to dispense too much. It only takes a wee bit to do the job. I don't know if the dispenser can be redesigned but that's a thought. Not a problem--just a caution. The product itself does just what it claims; improves the appearance and texture of that delicate under-eye skin. I'm glad I tried both of these Petunia products. They deliver."

1992,__label2__,"I was a bit skeptical about trying the Earl Grey Black tea using a Keurig. I'm a bit a tea traditionalist and make it the old fashioned way I learned years ago. To my surprise, this makes a very nice cuppa. For those times when you just want one (or two) cups, and are in a bit of a hurry, this is especially nice. The lemon & bergamont flavors are well balanced. I've always been a Twinings Earl Grey fan; I think the Capital Teas brand is also delicious. Yes, it's a bit pricey. It's also organic which is probably why."

This battery powered Weed Eater was very easy to assemble, the operation instructions are easy to understand & charging the battery for many hours lasts for about 90 minutes of continuous usage, plus I can go anywhere and use it instead of only going as far as a cord could reach. I consider this item to be terrific even though you should clean it after each use like I do to keep it running properly as suggested."
1995,__label2__,"This book collects the Tenth Doctor's first comic book stories, with all but the last one having Rose as his companion. The strips originally appeared in Doctor Who Magazine Issues 365-380 and the the 2007 Doctor Who Story Book.<br /><br />The Betrothal of Sontar (365-367): The first 10th Doctor comic book story and the titular story from this collection finds the Doctor on an arctic world where a bunch of deviations in the Sontarans have a base far from the action of the war and under the command of a purebred Sontaran who ends ups using the Doctor to find a doomsday weapon. This is actually the weakest story in the book. It's a Sontaran story where no one acts like a Sontaran. The purebed Sontaran has a mustache and sits around alone with his chest plate off revealing a hairy chest and wears fur shoulder pads. Even with a generic alien, this would be an average story. For bungling the Sontarans, it's a notch below that. Grade: D+<br /><br />The Lodger (368): The Doctor is stuck on Earth and living with Mickey for a spell. The story is fun and does a nice job putting the Doctor into a unique situation. Roberts would later take the idea of the comic and make it a TV script for the 11th Doctor. You'll find the barebones of the idea here but other than the Doctor being good at soccer, little of the plot crosses over. Grade: A-<br /><br />F.A.Q. (369-371): This is a story that actually is reminiscent of &#34;Fear Her&#34; (a story that aired in the same series as the comic strips),  so it's weird the magazine ran this one.  The story is better than &#34;Fear Her&#34; but the similarities are striking. At any rate, the Doctor and Rose arrive in a block where weird things are happening and people are disappearing and strange things start happening including mysterious disappearance and three boys being turned into trees. It all seems to center on a boy and is sister. This story twists around like a pretzel, it's very clever and rich with a lot of emotion, psychology, andmisdirection at work. The commentary in the back reveals the real life modeling of the characters which makes the story even more enjoyable. Great concept and really good execution. Grade: A<br /><br />The Futurists (372-374): This is the type of story you see in comics, audio, and novels, but never on the TV series as we have a story based on an obscure fact of history, sprinkle in sci fi and enjoy. In this case, the Doctor and Rose land in Italy between the Wars where the Futurists are beginning a movement that would become Italian fascism. An alien transports one of these Futurists back in time and gives him the chance to conquer the world. This is a wonderfully researched story that has several great twists in the final parts. Mike Collins art is great throughout the book (excepting some of the Sontaran designs in the first story of course.) but this is his best work in the book. I love his drawings of 1920s Italy and the clothing for the era is superb too. There's also a few nice humor bits sprinkled throughout.I loved Rose showing the psychic paper to an illiterate soldier. Grade: A+<br /><br />Interstellar Overdrive (375-376): The TARDIS lands on a tour ship featuring a zombified singer leading a band of misfit has-beens. Of course, there's a murder mystery and a few nice end-jokes. The Time Loop that's a big plot device for the cliffhanger is a bit weak as the Doctor and Rose remember everything which serves to expedite the time loop solution but also isn't really how those things should work. Still, this is a fun story. Grade: B+<br /><br />Opera of Doom (2007 Doctor Who Story Book): This story finds the Doctor taking Rose to the opera where strange things are afoot and an alien eats music. This is a story that's too short but that's really the fault of the BBC which demanded a shorter length to protect its Doctor Who Annual and that hurt this tale. It could have done with a few more pages, but it's okay as is with a nice comic and some good lines. Grade:B<br /><br />The Green Eyed Monster (DWM 377): In Rose's final comic story, writer Nev Fountain decided to play with the idea promoted by many that Rose and her crew were kind of poor and trashy where Rose's adventures with the Doctor and one adventure in particular are fodder for a Jerry Springereseque Daytime talk show. This strip not only gets Mickey in, but also Jackie and in a quiet unusual way. Fountain manages to gently poke fun at some of Doctor Who's tropes as an alien princess tells the Doctor, &#34;Our scientists have been mystified as to why our planet is solely populated by stunningly attractive with physical ages of eighteen to twenty.&#34; The strip does a lot in 10 pages, playing with Rose's jealousy of other women around the Doctor, perceptions of the Tyler family, and even works a riff of Peter Davison's famous line from the Fury of the Deep. Nicely done. Grade: A<br /><br />The Warkeeper's Crown: The only visual teaming of the Brigadier and a revived series Doctor finds the Brigadier kidnapped from a Remembrance Day ceremony in full uniform. He arrives to find he's being asked to lead a war-like species into battle because he's the greatest military leader the Doctor knows. They also kidnap Mike Yates, however instead of the Brigadier's former UNIT aide, they kidnap a back bench member of parliament whose kind of petty. There are a few confusing points in the plot, but this is ultimately a love letter to the Brigadier and it works. It's a great dynamic between the post-time War Doctor and the Brigadier as the Brig realizes that the Doctor has been a war. Good stuff.  Also, a key moment from the Series 8 finale may have had its genesis in the last page of this comic. Grade: A-<br /><br />With the exception of the first story, I found most everything else in the book to be thoroughly enjoyable. There are some great concepts. Even though, many of these were planned with very little known of the 10th Doctor they captured the character well. Rose was usually pretty good, though she did occasionally become a bit of a comic foil. This is a very solid volume of comics from Doctor Who magazine that's a must read for fans of the 10th Doctor."

1997,__label2__,". . . my goldfish are alive!  My two large goldfish (about 5 inches nose to tail) live in a 10 gallon tank with a waterfall filter.  We went on a two week trip and I was worried about how they would eat.  I'm glad I found these 14-day feeders.  When I got home, the blocks were gone, but the water was clear and the fish were healthy.  It worked exactly as promised."
1998,__label2__,"I love salt scrubs.  This one is a little pricy but the container is huge so it will last you a long time.  (You really don't need to use salt scrubs every day, anyway.)  I generally only use them on my upper arms, because that's where I'm least happy with my skin, although there's no reason you couldn't use this all over.    It has a lovely citrus (lime) scent.  It separates a little when stored but the container does mention that you should mix it up before using.  Shaking will not be effective -- you'll want something stiff like a knife to stir it, because it's pretty thick. Or just take the shortcut I've been using and try to get a little of the oil and a little of the solid part and mix it in your palm.    I can really feel this working.  One thing to watch out for -- this may sting a bit if you use it right after shaving.  I use it typically at the end of a shower, after shaving under my arms, and if a little salt migrates down there, it can hurt.  So just be careful where/when you apply it.  (It's not bad, but it was somewhat surprising the first time I experienced the sensation, so I thought I would mention it.)    The salt dissolves as you rub this around.  When you rinse it off, there's a bit of residue left over, but this absorbs pretty well into the skin within a few minutes of getting out of the shower.  And it's very moisturizing, even if you don't follow with a lotion.    In the end, I definitely think the appearance of the skin on my upper arms has improved since I started using this.  Plus, I love the smell.  I'm torn as to whether to buy a different scent (so I can try them all) or get the same one again, when I run out."
1999,__label2__,"This is a guitar I've had for, oh, at least 12 years now.  And it's held up.<br /><br />It's first important for me to mention that this is a very good guitar ***at this price point***.  Indeed, parts of this guitar certainly exceeded my expectations, with the fit and finish of the wood being really quite good.  On mine, some hardware (switches, dials, etc) was wobbly in the fittings so I did need to take some time to address those points.  On the other hand, the tuners were nice right out of the box.  So go figure.<br /><br />It also bears mentioning, clearly, that this is a Chinese product.  Sure, it says &#34;crafted&#34; in China, but it's still not of this shore so if that bothers you, well, there you go.  I don't have a problem with it as this is not a keepsake instrument, but even that said this instrument has surprised me at times, making it easy for me to overlook the country of origin.  However,  like other Chinese &#34;crafts,&#34; sometimes you can see the choices they made that gets you to that attractive price point.  For instance, this has a rosewood fingerboard.  Rosewood in and of itself isn't bad, but I don't think it's the best choice on this style of guitar (my opinion, don't shoot me).  It's cheaper than the alternatives though, so that's probably why it's there.<br /><br />I've seen some consistency issues across the line as well.  For instance, the color of mine is more of a washed out blue, approaching a bluish lavender in fact.<br /><br />Tone on this is VERY surprising.  It sounds great!  Seriously, it's got this kind of timbre to it that I can't describe.  It reminds me of the kid that grew up poor but ended up going to high school in the rich part of town.  It's going to try harder and it brings something unique.  Ditch the factory strings and put some good 'uns on there, and I think you'll be happy with the result.<br /><br />For an informal instrument where you don't feel like spending the green for a name brand, this one works quite well.  Again, it's fun for me to just jam on without worrying about turning heads because of the name on headpiece.  I like this instrument.  A lot."
2000,__label2__,"This review is for the 31&#34; Long Curly Gold Yellow Wig<br /><br />Free product provided for evaluation and review.<br /><br />Wow, this wig is gorgeous.  It is a very nice sunny blond.  It should work for blond yellow cosplays.<br />It is nice and full, and the wig-cap inside it is tightly woven and lace at the crown, making it an easy wig to sew into if that treatment is needed for a costume. I also like that they made the interior a light beige and that really helps it look more natural. It does adjust inside.<br /><br />The hair is quite natural looking - my natural blond hair is in picture beside it - it compares very well to natural hair, it is just a bit shinier.<br />It’s easy to comb and work with.  The waves are loose and the cut is long layers, which give it some added volume.<br />It can be styled with setting lotion and a hairdryer on cool or no heat, or set and curled and left to dry.  It has retained it’s out of box waviness well for me.<br /><br />It should fit most adults.  It fits me perfectly and I am a cap size MEDIUM with a head diameter of 22.5.”  It would stretch a bit more if needed.  It does have straps so it will adjust down to about a 21”.  I think any smaller than that would need a smaller long wig.<br /><br />It can be pinned if needed as the hair is a bit weighty from length, but generally it stays on very well, but it might need a few pins if you plan on being active.  That’s normal for long wigs. You’d want to use blond ones with this wig.  The bangs cover the hairline well.<br /><br />As I mentioned, it is a bit weighty in the back from length - blonde bobby pins will help secure it if needed.  I recommend them for us with this wig."

This is not the choice for a main DVD player as it lacks any wifi capabilities for streaming Netflix, Pandora or You Tube. It is also ideal for a vacation home or furnished rental property. When it comes to DVD players today this one is as basic as it gets."
2002,__label2__,"I bought this for my Canon 7D and have had it for over 5 months. I wanted to protect my camera from nicks and scratches since I regularly bring my camera on my hikes -- and this skin does a good job of it.<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />- Protection<br />The skin is very thick, which will not only protect the camera from nicks and scratches but help dampen the impact from bumps. (The thick skin does make the already large 7D a little pudgy.)<br /><br />- Durable<br />The skin's held up very well to all the frequent handling I subject it. There are no rips, tears, or any form of degradation. The previous skin I got for my Canon XSi held up to years of heavy use. This one looks to be equally durable.<br /><br />- Accurate Cutouts<br />The cutouts (for the screen, mode dial, lens mount, battery compartment, etc.) line up perfectly. Unlike my previous skin, this one lets me change lenses easily because the skin doesn't obstruct the area where the lens meets the mount.<br /><br />Cons<br />----<br />- Hard Screen Protector Slides Around<br />I'm worried the hard screen protector does more harm than good since it slides around and could potentially scratch the LCD screen (even if the LCD had a regular ""soft"" screen protector on since the very edges of the LCD aren't covered). Forget the Hard Screen Protector; a regular screen protector (included) will do the job just fine.<br /><br />- Buttons Not Clearly Labeled<br />This problem seems specific to only the skins for certain camera models. On the 7D, the labels on the buttons are imprinted as part of the molding, but they are barely legible.<br /><br />---<br />The Bottom Line: The Delkin Snug-it Pro is a well-made and durable product that offers the camera very good protection. The only shortcoming (for the skin for the Canon 7D) is the labels for the buttons are not clearly labelled (not a problem for me personally because I already know my way around the camera)."
2003,__label2__,"This pad reminds me of a very high quality &#34;Magic Eraser&#34; if you are familiar with those. It is designed to work with the Griot's Garage system.  It's 6 1/2 inches so it covers a good bit of area making the work go fairly quickly.<br />Alone, it will get scuffs off as well as very minor scratches, and with some rubbing compound, it will take out most fine or a tad bit deeper scratches.  It is machine washable and made in the USA.  It doesn't leave swirls or streaks at all.<br />It is very easy to remove what I call scuffs.  My truck is a pewter color and had some black scuffs on it. Using this pad, they were gone in just a few minutes and very little work.  It gives a really nice finish."

Everything inside the face is brown, so it's kind of hard to read, especially at night. That's my only real complaint.  It would be nice if it had luminous hands, or a back light (like Timex's ""indiglo"") to compensate for the lack of  clarity.  The watch band is stiff - will take some breaking in, like new shoes. I had a cuff watch band that works beautifully with this watch, making it a striking looking watch. But, again, it would be nice to have greater clarity in the watch face.  I have several Fossil's and they are well made. The vendor did finally get back to me regarding shipping. So, overall - I will give it a 4, but not a 5."

2006,__label2__,"I have been using these blades for about two years now, and find that I get an excellent shave from the blades.  I have a very tough beard, and find these blades do well at cutting, but I do have to make two or three passes in some areas to get a good shave, but I have this issue with other razors also.  I use the power razor with the vibration on.  I was skeptical of this idea, and never tried it before purchasing one of the razors about two years ago that was a great deal, and found the vibration was more beneficial than I expected.<br /><br />I also wanted to point out that the area above the blades flips back allowing you to shave the area above your lip directly below your nose.  I did not read the instructions and was initially concerned that the razor would not shave that location, but it works well once you know how the razor blade operates.<br /><br />Obviously, these are not cheap disposable razors.  One of my top concerns whe purchasing razor blades is how long will they last.  I generally shave 5 - 6 days per week, and can get at least 5 to 6 weeks out of one blade.  I have purchased disposable razors, which still cost about a third of the cost of these razors, but I am ready to toss them after half a dozen shaves, which, in the long run, I find more value in purchasing these razor blades over disposable razors.<br /><br />I've used many different blades over my thirty some years of shaving, and would rank these blades among the top.  I would definately recommend this blade to anyone who wants a good shave, and is mindful of the value in buying good blades over cheap blades."

2013,__label2__,"I transport a lot of electronic equipment for my work, often cross-country. Courtesy of careless baggage handlers and drivers, I have watched my precious equipment thrown to ground from baggage holds, tossed into trunks and simply dropped – once into a pool of Philadelphia slush. No harm came to my equipment, though I can’t say the same of my heart which stopped beating during these incidents. I have come to appreciate hard cases.<br /><br /> Xsories is a new entry into a market dominated by Pelican. Pelican is a premium brand and you pay for its stature. But you get an excellent case.<br /><br /> Xsories offers three cases, all of which are worthy competitors to Pelican and have lower prices for equivalent sizes.<br /><br /> The XSories Big Black Box 2.0 Shockproof Waterproof Storage Case feels as sturdy as a Pelican case. Made of “ ultra high-impact ABS plastic”, it doesn’t flex much when pressed. At some point, I will figure out a kind of torture test like dropping it with an unused camera inside on to a concrete floor. But visually and to the touch, the case feels strong. The latches are positive and there is a hasp for a lock. The case may also be fitted with a strap which is a definite advantage over any of my Pelican cases. There is also a grip handle.<br /><br /> The inside of the Big Black Box is not particularly commodious, measuring about 10 x 7 x 3 inside.<br /><br /> The interior is fitted with a foam insert that has been pre-cut into small cubes. You just pluck out the cubes to create a space shaped to fit your components. This means putting some effort into designing your inside to get maximum utility from the space. There is a foam layer on the bottom of the case and inside the lid. Your equipment inside is going to be well protected from shock.<br /><br /> This is an all-climate case with an operating range of -40f through +176f. The case is described as “water-proof”, though I am not sure just what the limits of that claim are. I do know t7hat heavy rain and winter slush will probably not penetrate. There is also an air pressure compensation valve, though I have never knowingly used this feature on a case.<br /><br /> Overall, Xsories has created a very worthy and less expensive competitor to Pelican and other “premium” brands, though you might want to consider the next step up in their line, the “Huge Black Box” which offers more interior space. It all depends on your needs. The “Big Black Box” weighs less than 2 pounds, the “Huge Black Box” weighs slightly over 4 pounds, which is also a considceration.<br /><br /> I like this case. So far I think it compares very well to the more expensive Pelican.<br /><br />Jerry"

In the 1970's and 1980's, there were only a few flavors of International Coffee and they also tasted very weak.

2028,__label2__,"The CROCODILE DUNDEE TRIPLE FEATURE is a triple feature movie set that contains all three of the Crocodile Dundee movies in one volume.<br /><br />Although he was a fairly well known tv star in Australia, Paul Hogan was a virtual unknown in the United States. Then, in 1986, along came CROCODILE DUNDEE and Hogan became a huge international movie star who also helped make Australia a dream vacation destination for millions of Americans.<br /><br />Hogan stars in the movie as Mick Dundee, a part Aborigine crocodile hunter who doesn’t hunt for fun. Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) is a New York journalist on assignment in Australia. Before coming back home she’s trying to track down a local man from the very small town of Walkabout Creek who supposedly had part of his leg bit off by a croc, but managed to survive and crawled out of the Outback several days later. She eventually meets the man who the story is about and he agrees to take her on a journey to retrace the steps of that episode. This leads to some hilarious moments in the Australian wild with Sue, but the story takes an even more interesting turn when Mick agrees to accompany Sue to New York City where he explores the urban jungle.<br /><br />Hogan was not only the star of the movie, but he also created the story and co-wrote the screenplay. The chemistry between himself and Kozlowski is exceptional and it really came as no surprise that the two eventually ended up in a very long term real-life romance with each other.<br /><br />CROCODILE DUNDEE was a major surprise hit when it first was released. Other than some 1980s fashions with Sue and the people in New York, the film remains fresh and vibrant a quarter of a century after it first came out. The movie has a great, well-written story with some very colorful characters and some good actors who have some amazing on-screen chemistry. There are some really funny lines that became catch phrases of the time (“You call that a knife?”), but there is also humor that works on several different levels from classic slapstick to wry and witty. Also, although there are a few adult references, CROCODILE DUNDEE is basically a family film. It was rated PG-13 in 1986, but is only a PG movie by today’s standards.<br /><br />Although the movie might not be a critical darling, CROCODILE DUNDEE was a huge popular success that remains fresh and relevant today and offers something for everyone in a family to enjoy.<br /><br />It's rare that a sequel (not part of a planned series of films) lives up to the original film; sequels almost always aren't as good as the original films they follow. CROCODILE DUNDEE II is one of those few sequels that's just as good as the original and, in some ways, is an even better film. The movie begins in New York City. Although he has been in New York City for a while, Mic (Paul Hogan) is still ignorant of city life. Sue's (Linda Kozlowski) writing career is bigger than ever. One day Sue receives some photographs from her ex-husband Bob that depict the murder of a man at the hands of the lead of a Colombian drug cartel. Her life is in immediate danger and she ends up getting kidnapped. Mic rescues her, but knows the danger isn't over and that the criminals will not stop. So, Mic takes Sue with him back to Australia so he can protect her and fight off the drug lords on his own turf.<br /><br />CROCODILE DUNDEE II has some humorous moments, but it's a more serious movie than the original. The audience actually gets to see some real character development with Mic and Sue. The first movie was more of a comedy with some romance thrown in; the romance actually wasn't the main focal point of the story. CROCODILE DUNDEE II is more of an action-adventure movie with a good dose of comedy that's actually tied together by a love story; the relationship between Mic and Sue is the catalyst for most of the plot. I actually enjoyed the more serious tone of the picture and found it gave it a bit of gravitas that the first movie never really had.<br /><br />I first saw CROCODILE DUNDEE II in a movie theatre as a kid and I remember thinking even then how good of a sequel it was. I've seen both films several times since then and my impression of CROCODILE DUNDEE II has not changed: it's a great sequel to a classic 80s movie that remains as memorable now as it did when I first saw it.<br /><br />CROCODILE DUNDEE II is a great sequel and follow-up film to CROCODILE DUNDEE. It's got a good plot and finds the right balance between comedy and action-adventure.<br /><br />The third movie in this triple feature is CROCODILE DUNDEE IN LOS ANGELES. After thirteen years in limbo, Mick &#34;Crocodile&#34; Dundee is back. This was a really enjoyable movie that everyone in my family enjoyed watching. The picture provides lots of laughs and the story works rather well.<br /><br />Mick and the love of his life, Sue, have a son together and are living in Mick's home territory of the Australian Outback. However, a publisher at a Los Angeles newspaper that Sue's father owns suddenly dies and her father temporarily offers her the position until a permanent replacement can be found. Surprisingly, Mick agrees and they move to LA. Once there, Sue begins to investigate the sudden death of the previous publisher and Mick goes undercover at a movie studio.<br /><br />The critics blasted this film, but like many of the movies they review, they are way off target. The film is funny and family oriented. The plot is more believable than many big budgeted affairs and there is very little violence and no sleaze. The only major drawback about the movie is that it has been thirteen years since the last Crocodile Dundee film. Still, the movie fits well within the trilogy. Overall CROCODILE DUNDEE IN LOS ANGELES is a delightful movie that the entire family can enjoy.<br /><br />Although the Crocodile Dundee movies aren't really a trilogy (they are more like two movies that work really well together and then a third movie epilogue), it’s great to find a DVD set that has all three of these movies together in one package."

2035,__label2__,"“Gone Girl” is a David Fincher thriller, and that will tell you something about the film. This is a story about the “missing Amy,” which is dark, twisted and unpredictable. I am not saying this is one of the greatest mysteries ever filmed. It simply is not, because the script is, if scrutinized closely, full of illogical things. Still, it is darkly entertaining enough to forget these plot holes, thanks to the slick direction and fine acting.<br /><br />The story starts with Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), whose beautiful wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) goes missing. The police investigation starts, followed by heavy press coverage. The Nick slowly realizes that despite their five-year marriage, he knew so little about his wife. Not only that; people start to think that Nick is not what he seems.<br /><br />So what really happened? “Gone Girl” takes time in unfolding its complicated story, and maybe too much time. (It runs about 150 minutes.) But don’t ever expect something like “Zodiac,” or a mystery based on realism. What happens in the last 30 minutes of “Gone Girl” is so incredible.<br /><br />I’m giving four stars because of some of the effective performances from the cast, including Carrie Coon as Nick’s twin sister Margo. Perhaps her likeable character is the most convincing part of the film."

Other games have been fixing their mistakes and this one seems like it just cannot get there in time for anything to matter.<br /><br />This is M's flagship franchise.

You could probably get by feeding two people with this, I wouldn't go beyond that, especially if you are active (out hiking, etc). You get a decent chunk of protein (11 Grams per serving) and unlike the pro packs, the cholesterol is more manageable (100 mg).<br /><br />The food itself is actually pretty good, especially for what it is. It's not like a gourmet restaurant or anything but it tastes pretty good. If you keep these around for emergencies, it's definitely nice to have something that tastes good."

The best thing I have found is just to use petroleum jelly, however that leaves your skin very sticky and unpleasant. I've tried using mineral oil as well but that is too light for me. So when I was approached to try this, I was enthusiastic to accept. This Argan oil seems like the perfect fit.<br /><br />The bottle is somewhat small and due to the price, I'm hesitant to use it all over my body. The good part is you need very little to get the job done. One squirt gives you about a pea-sized amount and that is more than enough for hands and even forearms. There is a light, pleasant scent that is natural, and the oil works quickly.<br /><br />The instructions say you can use it in your hair, which I did, but the result wasn't what I hoped. It made my hair look greasy - as if I hadn't washed in several days - instead of shiny and smooth.<br /><br />Still, I use it everyday for my hands and love it so far."

2049,__label2__,"The Fosmon HD1832 Intelligent 5x1 5-Port HDMI Switcher is identical to a number of other no-brand generic HDMI switchers being offered on Amazon, with the important difference that it seems to be better finished and, most importantly, it includes a power supply adapter. There are a couple of other no-name switchers, that are otherwise identical, being sold without the power adapter. Obviously, having the power adapter is a plus. The unit is easy to set up and install, has the advantage of having the HDMI output on the opposite side as three of the HDMI inputs, and it has an IR remote sensor and a remote. I would worry more about the remote failing than the switch itself. So I would suggest making sure that you enter the remote commands in a learning remote if you have one, and use that remote instead of the supplied remote. In a pinch it has manual switching on the unit also. All easy to setup and has worked just fine for all kinds of HDMI devices plugged into it for display on my TV. RECOMMENDED."
2050,__label2__,"The TAN FURREAL FRIENDS HOP 'N CUDDLE BUNNY from Hasbro is a great toy to give away as a gift at Easter. The bunny runs on 3 AA batteries, a set of which is included when you purchase the toy. The fur on this toy mechanical bunny is very soft, which does make it good for cuddling. When you press down on the bunny's back, it begins hopping around in a kind of circle. It also makes a series of different clicking sounds that kind of sound like the bunny is sniffling or nibbling (though they kind of sound like bunny noises, they don't really sound much like the rabbits I've worked with before-they sound more like Bugs Bunny eating a carrot than anything else). There's a switch where you can turn the bunny off if the noise or the hopping becomes too much of a nuisance. The toy is recommended for children four and up. This would be a good Easter gift for a younger child and it appeals to girls more than boys."
2051,__label2__,"UPDATE - February 2, 2015    After I wrote my review the manufacturer of this bag had the bag redesigned so that the zipper opening runs the full width of the top of the bag (and then a bit) to allow for easy insertion of your computer.  A copy of the new version landed on my porch yesterday. Kudos for a great response!  (Now if they had only changed that lining!)    ORIGINAL REVIEW    I love the look of this stylish black/dark gray denim [[ASIN:B00QM3BH0G Casual Messenger Crossbody Bag Shoulder Bag]]. Loaded with pockets and zippered compartments, the bag features a diagonal zipper compartment on the top flap and an adjustable strap of heavy duty webbing.  The bag is well constructed of mostly heavy duty materials and features attractive antiqued brass metal fittings.  There are, however, some things that I do not like about this bag.    First, the product page gives the bag's dimensions as 14.8x11.8x4.3 inches and clearly states that the bag will hold a 15 inch laptop.  I know of no way at all that one can fit 15 inches of inflexible material into a space only 14.8 inches long.  Clearly, this must be a typo.  Accordingly, I tested the bag on both my daughter's 14 inch Alienware computer and a 13.3 inch netbook.  The 14 inch Alienware simply would not go into the bag, no matter how we turned it. (The zipper opening is only about 12 inches.)  I did get the netbook into the bag by putting one corner in first and then turning the device, but the case did scrape against the zipper.  Frequently putting the netbook into the bag and removing it would certainly result in a severely marred netbook case.  An iPad does fit adequately.    The exterior of the bag is made of 100% cotton denim, which makes it washable.  The lining, however, is a heavy, brown, not particularly attractive nylon of not-particularly great quality.  The two fabrics have different shrink rates, so while you can in theory wash this bag, you can also expect to find your lining larger than the bag itselfafter you do so.  A cotton fabric would have been much more attractive and easily eliminated that problem.    Grandma's $0.02 - Nice stylish, heavy duty bag."
2052,__label2__,"This is a fairly entertaining retread of familiar territory, and I did find parts to be extremely moving (especially when dealing with loss).<br /><br />However, the book failed to impress me for a number of reasons:<br />1/ A slew of cliched situations and plot devices (ancient prophecy, circle of power, unnamed evil afoot, etc. )<br />2/ The characters were entirely one dimensional, and it was apparent at first encounter who was good and who was evil. No shades of grey.<br />3/ Each character's motivation was similarly obvious. Greed/power for the evil, and duty/honor for the good.<br />4/ The major plot line was extremely weak, was resolved with minimal fuss, and ended with a just-as-weak cliffhanger.<br /><br />This is not epic GRRM, and neither is it even close to the more mass market efforts by Goodkind. What it is, is a lazy read with minimal fuss and excitement, that won't raise your pulse rate as you read it.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars for writing style, 2 stars for content, and rounded up.<br /><br />Happy Reading!"

Otherwise, children can do most everything else themselves. It's easy to use, and surprisingly not too messy at all. The ink is not washable, so you'll want to put newspaper down just in case the ink drips. Kids can learn about colors in a fresh and unique way. They can mix their own colors with a helpful chart or try their own. Plus, they can create labels on each marker to name their colors whatever they wish. And when supplies are low, you can purchase additional ink or markers separately as needed. The wait time for ink to soak into the marker is only a couple minutes."

It took us a few tries to get the hang of cutting the right size bags and then using the sealer, but once we figured it all out we became vacuum-sealing fools! The two biggest mistakes we made to start off were cutting the bags too short (not enough room for the sealer to properly do its thing) and cutting the bags to hastily, leaving a ragged edge that also got in the way. Once we took our time and did it right, all went smoothly. While we did receive this roll of bag material gratis from the seller, we put it to use to objectively find out how well it performed and my statements here reflect that testing.<br /><br />If you are looking for affordable vacuum food sealer bag material of this style and size, for use similar to what I have described above, then we recommend this bag roll from VonShef based on our experience with it.

These are working so i'll keep buying them as they are a value price wise for me too. I was paying $17 for 28 at my local shopping mart.

2059,__label2__,"The Ernie Ball MVP is a great volume pedal. I am used to a Morley Little Alligator volume pedal, which is optical, not controlled by a volume pot. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. For instance, the string that controls the volume pot on the MVP will eventually fray and need to be replaced. Likewise, the pot itself may go bad over time – hopefully not during a live show!<br /><br />The optical is certainly more reliable, but I’ve noticed that the sweep on the Morley is not as smooth as the sweep on the MVP. There are advantages and disadvantages to this as well. For instance, the Morley is great for cello-like single note attacks. The MVP is far better (IMHO) for ambient swells. I use ambient swells in the church setting where I play, almost like giving the keyboard player a break when he/she is covering more piano parts and we need the added pads.<br /><br />The MVP, like the Morley, has a minimum knob which allows you to set a lower volume in the toe up position. Personally, I have never used this feature as I prefer to do swells from no volume to full volume. That being said, I can see where this feature would be very helpful before OR after your drives. Before the drives you could use it to adjust gain/distortion levels – after the drives you could use it as an overall volume boost. The MVP also has the added feature of a decibel boost knob. This is great, especially in conjunction with the minimum knob, or by itself if you need the added gain. Personally, I don’t use this feature as well but I can still see the added benefit.<br /><br />What is also nice about this pedal is the fact that it is buffered/powered (9v). So, if you use the tuner out (as I do) you don’t lose high end frequencies. In other words, it doesn’t suck your tone.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great volume pedal and I have it secure on my pedal board. I won’t say that I’m not apprehensive about the string eventually fraying and breaking, because I am. However,it is especially smooth and works most excellently for ambient volume swells. Definite five stars from me!"

Perhaps the best of these is one where you grow your own ""geode"" inside an artificial plaster shell, although you will want to take you time and be sure to cast the plaster with care - it's not the most durable material. This kit stands out for the variety and breadth of experiments it offers -- it's not just another crystal-growing set, but also includes numerous gem and mineral samples and various ways of testing their composition, strength and density. The wide scope of the set is its strong point, while it loses points for the stinginess of the materials included... The samples are small, the materials not always the best. Kids who are already into rocks and science in general might be able to make better use of the activity book is they provide their own materials, particularly if they already have a stronger, higher quality magnifying glass than the one Ravensberger provides.

The zipper pulls, which look like little pencils, are thick rubber - easy to pull and they don't get too hot or too cold to the touch when there are weather extremes. My only criticism is that the bottom of the backpack has zero padding. This means that books or electronics will get damaged over time every time this bag is put on the ground. Rolling up a washcloth on the bottom helps, but it can shift around and built-in padding would have been preferred. Our youngest granddaughter is in love with owls and obsessed with waltzing around the house with her big sister's backpacks - so now she's got her very own.

The litter is very easy to scoop up after my cats have done their thing, which is great because my cats do their thing a lot! The one thing I don't like is how much litter is ending up outside the litter box. My cats seem to like this litter so I am thinking it might be too light.

2078,__label2__,"We really liked this.  We eventually had to take it out of the crib, around 12 months because my daughter would play with it and not sleep.  She quickly figured out how to turn it on and off.  I have no idea why it has a remote, we never used it until my kid figured it out and enjoyed it.  Eventually we strapped it on the back of a dining room chair and she played with it until about 20 months, when I decided I couldn't bear to hear the music anymore and finally took it down.  She loved turning it on and dancing to the music. She was far less interested in the moving parts.  I can't find the remote now, so good thing we never used it.  I'm going to pass it on to another family who can listen to the same songs OVER AND OVER.  I've seen the complaints about the strap.  I had the same issue too and thought it was defective, but I figured out how to adjust the back of the toy so it fit around the crib rail appropriately and then tighten it.  I can't tell you exactly what I did that fixed it, but once I got it situated correctly I had no problems with it easily coming undone.

Not only did the lens still work perfectly but there wasn't a scratch on it. The lens hood has a single small scuff mark but that was all. A lens that can take this type of a beating without so much as a scratch deserves a review.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- This lens and the 50mm 1.8g are arguably the best value lenses that Nikon makes. The $100 instant rebates Nikon has been having on this lens recently make it a steal!<br />- Super, ridiculously sharp from 1.8<br />- Focus is silent, fast, and spot on with my D7000<br />- Beautiful bokeh<br />- 99% of the $1500 85mm 1.4G for 1/3 of the price.<br />- Override manual focus with a touch.<br />- Includes lens hood<br />- Perfect portrait lens for DX or FX.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Made from durable, bounce off the concrete proof plastic instead of metal. Not sure if this is really a con.<br /><br />I sold my $1000+ Nikon 85mm 1.4D and have never looked back. That lens focused slower, less accurate, and wasn't quite as sharp at 1.8. The only thing better about the 85 1.4D was that it was a hunk of solid metal and this lens is durable plastic. My pictures with the 1.8G are just as beautiful as the 1.4D. I don't regret selling the more expensive lens for one second after my experience with amazing lens."
2088,__label2__,"Our 8 yr. old daughter wanted this so much for Christmas. She couldn't have it at the time because of the absurd price Amazon had it but... thanks to Amazon's independent sellers, we were able to obtain a 'like new' copy which was indeed 'like new' for a fraction of what the game is currently listed at.  To make this short, this game is over in a couple of hours. Our little girl finished it in one evening playing together with a visiting friend. They liked it while it lasted because they could learn what planning a wedding could be like: they had to go to the music store, stationary store, book a venue, visit a boutique an so forth. But... there's not much to do other than picking items from a list while the game keeps track of things done and things to do. Once ready, there's the ceremony where your DS lets you take pictures to share with friends. If a fellow DS owner happens to be nearby, you can exchange wedding gifts with them - and that's okay because, magically, the gifts you give them don't disappear from the inventory. It's all over quickly.  There should be some replay value because there are several preset brides you can work for: lawyer, actress, designer, photographer, veterinarian... and you can do a custom bride but in practice our girl didn't feel like playing it again with a different bride and I don't believe she'll play the game ever again.  If it was for me, I'd give this game a 2 stars for ""I don't like it"" but the person who actually played it said it was 'OK' and that's 3 stars are for."

2094,__label2__,"This is the best picture quality of any TV I have had. It is a 4K TV and even though there isn't any 4K content yet without getting movie on a hard drive and paying out the nose. This Samsung upscales the content up and it looks pretty darn great. Noticeably sharper then others that I looked at. The sound is also very good. There are plenty of smart features and internet hookup without having any external devices like Roku, Apple TV. Upconverts any source inputted. Samsungs latest backlighting technology.<br /><br />I bought the TV for the picture quality not really for the 3D. Most of the smart features are just extra pluses.<br />It does a decent job of upscaling the HD content, but remember it is trying to upscale from HD to near 4K and the information is just not there for it to do real 4K. It, for the lack of better terms, makes a guess on what 4K should be. That withstanding it does guess well, and will offer a better picture than standard HD, just not UHD so expect that. Samsung isn't talking about what the specs are for the up scaling at the time of this review.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Excellent color and sharpness. Also controls to can easily adjust the picture to any way you wish (moe color saturation, less saturation, sharpness, brightness, etc) Lots of smart features I am still learning.<br /><br />2. Excellent sound upgrade from standard HD Samsungs. For the price it should have good sound huh.<br /><br />3. Watching Lord Of The Rings On This Will Make You Cry<br /><br />4. 3D works great and comes with four sets of glasses.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Dialog box pops up telling you that you can use voice controls. This is very distracting and I don't need the a dialog box on the TV to pop up to tell me this. Its in the instructions booklet. It doesn't happen very often- but it is annoying. You can disable this but it takes some time to dig through the screens until you are there.<br /><br />2. Heavier than standard HD versions of Samsungs, like the 8000.Good info for those mounting on wall.<br /><br />3. No Content to justify early adopter purchase price.<br /><br />4. Friends watching Lord Of The Rings (Also crying picture is so good) begain plotting to take ""Precious"" from us.<br /><br />There is just nothing to watch right now and the prices of these 4K sets are going to drop at least another 500 just like when the HD sets came on the scene. Plus the 4k technology will most likely get better when they decide just how the content is going to be implemented. On the upside Samsung uses what they call a Hub or One Connect box so if content inputs get better you can just replace the hub box instead of kicking yourself that you have to get a new set.<br /><br />I tried the Netflix 4K streaming and it's a mixed bag at this stage. Some of the nature documentaries look like 4K and some look more like 1080P.<br /><br />The UHD dvd players are coming so if you have this Samsung you will be ready from day one. I think even the xbox is going to offer 4k content when connected. Does have a superior picture than non UHD tv's. Its just gonna cost ya a little more brother. I had to have it. I couldnt wait. My current tv died on me and I had to do something. The only thing I could rationalize, being addicted to great new technology, was to go into debt to feed my habit. I am so ashamed at my weakness.<br /><br />In all seriousness:<br />My suggestion is if you must have the latest 4k tech then here it is. Much better than Sony especially with their no customer service. The LG's do look good, just not this good.<br /><br />UPDATE 4-25-2014<br /><br />Ok there has been a big controversy on whether this model comes with a one connect box or not. You get a different story everywhere. Found a Samsung training representative who spent two hours educating me on every 4k tv on earth and what was what. One Connect; 2013 version of this model had the external One Connect box. 2014 version of this model has internal One Connect with no external box. When One Connect technology is updated you can get the external box and it overrides the internal to keep everything cutting edge. He said samsung is supporting One Connect for a guaranteed four years to guard against your tv becoming obsolete. I asked him about the 1080p to 4k upscaling. He said yes it does a good job at kicking up standard HD better than Sony or LG, but if you want to see something great, get a 4K bluray player, then he drug me around to show what it could do. It was very impressive. He shared a story about the 9000 which requires an external One Connect box to opperate as all the technology is in the box and the tv is basically a monitor, said stores all over the place are misplacing the boxes when they move a tv and have all these dead big screens everywhere.This TV is a keeper.<br /><br />SPECIFICATIONS:<br /><br />Glossy screen, black bezel and cabinet, silver T-Shape stand<br /><br />The Tuner receives over-the-air HDTV broadcasts (Seperate HDTV antenna required)<br /><br />QAM cable TV tuner<br /><br />RVU-compatible (for DIRECTV) -- DIRECTV subscribers with the Genie Whole-Home HD DVR can watch live broadcast and stored content on this TV without an additional receiver<br /><br />Ultra High Definition TV with 4K screen resolution (3840 x 2160 pixels)<br /><br />HEVC for compatibility with streamed 4K content from sources like Netflix®<br /><br />TV Displays 3D images when you wear Samsung's active 3D glasses (4 pairs of glasses are included)<br /><br />2D-to-3D conversion adds 3D-like depth to non-3D video sources<br /><br />LED edge backlight with Precision Black hardware-based local dimming and UHD Dimming software-based dimming for superb contrast and black levels<br /><br />Clear Motion Rate 1200 blur reduction 240Hz refresh rate plus backlight scanning<br /><br />UHD video upscaling seamlessly upconverts SD and HD content<br /><br />Internet-ready Smart TV<br /><br />Supports up to 5.1-channel audio with streaming movie services like Netflix and Vudu(tm) (audio quality depends on your connection speed)<br /><br />Built-in Wi-Fi to link to a wireless network<br /><br />Quad-core processor for seamless web browsing and app multitasking<br /><br />Quad Screen splits the TV screen into four quadrants so you can watch live TV, video clips, and the web all at once<br /><br />AllShare video and music streaming from a DLNA-compatible Windows PC<br /><br />MHL-compatible HDMI input for viewing photos/videos from a compatible smartphone on the TV's screen<br /><br />2-way screen mirroring -- send content wirelessly from device-to-TV or TV-to-device with compatible smartphones and tablets<br /><br />Built-in stereo speakers (10 watts x 2 plus 20 watts for woofers)<br /><br />Comes with two remotes: a touchpad remote with built-in microphone for voice control, plus a standard illuminated button-based IR remote"

2096,__label2__,"For moving, storage or utility purposes one can always go to the local grocery or liquor store and get plenty of free boxes... if you catch them at the right time. But unless you know someone there, chances are that you'll end up with a motley mess of varying size cartons that may or may not suit your needs.<br /><br />A personal fAVorite for general, casual storage are these [[ASIN:B00GMOOB08 Bankers Box SmoothMove Classic Moving Boxes, Small, 15 x 12 x 10 Inches, Pack of 10 (7714203)]]. They'rs also available in packs of 5, 8, 12, 15 or 20, but do a quick math check to see which quantity fits your needs and cost per box.<br /><br />If you check the product page, at the time of this review, you'll see that these cartons are available in large, medium and small sizes, along with with a small/medium kit. This review is on the SmoothMove Classic Moving Boxes, Small, 15 x 12 x 10 Inches, Pack of 10, which is the size and quantity that I've used most frequently<br /><br />? Likes:<br /><br />+ 15x12x10-inch small size boxes after assembly; convenient and multi-purpose<br />+ Lift-off lid, has easy to carry handles at each end; no tape required<br />+ Double end double bottom construction; offers strength for heavy-duty moves and storage<br />+ Good for general household items, kitchen & bathroom goods; excellent for paper files<br />+ Easy set-up construction; lid ships attached to prevent lid loss, tears off for use<br />+ Made from strong 32 ECT C-Flute Kraft corrugated board; reusable and recyclable<br />+ Construction: 75% post-consumer recycled material content<br />+ Uniform size; stackable five-high or more depending on weight of contents<br /><br />? Dislikes<br /><br />- None at all; have reordered this size and quantity<br /><br />The above items list the subjective high points of these reusable cartons. For this reviewer, it's the uniformity of the size that matters most, as they can be easily stacked. Depending on the weight of the contents, these 15x12x10-inch cartons can be easily stacked five or six high with little danger of toppling. There's a section below the handle opening at the end of each box where you can note the contents of each, which is highly suggested.<br /><br />When I received my first order as an Amazon Vine selection, I wondered how easy they were to put together. As that turned out, it was only the first one that seemed slightly tricky, and once done it all made sense. Assembly is easy, and the directions are printed on the bottom of each box. Just follow the numbered steps and all should go just fine.<br /><br />Hints: though no tape is needed, if you plan to use these for storage, you may wish to put a small strip of standard 1.88"" to 2"" wide packaging tape over the handle openings. That should be enough to keep out any small critters that may reside in your storage area. And of course it's not advisable to store any foodstuffs other than canned goods in these cartons. Enough said on that.<br /><br />These Bankers Box SmoothMove Classic Moving Boxes are an excellent choice for moving and storage of your paper files, magazines, books, general household items, kitchen & bathroom goods. Just pick the size that best suits your personal needs, but remember that cartons can become heavier than you expect, especially with books and paper. The best part is that these uniform-sized boxes are very stackable, and can be used over and again.<br /><br />JW ? 6/20/2015"

I can't believe I'd left the cooler broken for almost 2yrs before I realized that a replacement cooler was only a few dollars.<br /><br />Please note that if you plan on replacing a peltier in an existing device you will need some thermal paste to ensure a solid thermal connection is made between the peltier and the heat sinks. All you need is a small amount spread thinly and evenly across the surface, an old credit card works well.<br /><br />Without thermal paste my cooler was only able to get down to 65 degrees (room temp 78), but once I applied the paste the cooler is now able to maintain a steady 54 degrees."

2099,__label2__,"Collecting: X-Men (2013) #18-22<br /><br />In the previous adventure, [[ASIN:0785189726 X-Men Volume 3: Bloodline]], the all-female X-Men's adventure was rooted firmly on planet earth.  In this book, the ladies are in space.  Earth's space based defense agency (SWORD) is under attack after Deathbird is rescued.  A crazy group of gene-splicing aliens called the Providian Order have made custom bad guys out of Brood and Skrull warriors. They will stop at nothing to take Deathbird back with them.<br /><br />The Providian Order's minions aren't the only ones hunting Deathbird.  The Shi'ar become unlikely allies of the X-Men as Rachel Grey's family history collides with that of one of Shi'ar counselors.  I was glad to see Rachel's past getting a little more development in these issues because she is a strong character.<br /><br />These issues create a self-contained story, so readers can pick this volume up without reading the prior episode and they won't have to wait until the next installment for the conclusion.  This all-female has a great line up that includes Storm, Psylocke, and Rachel Grey, And the 'all-female' angle seems to promise something different for an X-team.  Unfortunately, the all-female team engages in pretty run-of-the-mill superhero adventures.  That is to say, while the premise of an all-female casts promises something unique, this comic delivers a pretty standard plot.<br /><br />If you like X-Men and especially if you like X-Women, this volume will appeal to you.  There is plenty of action and outer space excitement.  I keep waiting for that 'something special' that really defines a female x-team, but I never quite get it.  I will continue following this series because I really enjoy the characters and the idea behind the group has tremendous promise.  The next adventure for this X-team can be found in [[ASIN:0785197265 X-Men Vol. 5: The Burning World]]"

I had a few friends over right after I got the diffuser and they loved the fact that it changed colors and were instantly intrigued by the design. The device has an auto shutoff (when it runs out of water) as well and you can also adjust it so that it will scent but not have the light. The only thing I do warn about is that unless you are trying to do a quick coverup of your stinky kitchen, perhaps only use 2 drops of oil and be sure to put the machine away from any food.  The first few times I ran the diffuser I set it on the kitchen table and, while eating a quick snack, I found myself being a bit overwhelmed by the scent. After moving it to a different spot and adding a little less oil, I find that it works much better.<br /><br />I love scented products and have used many different types for creating that ambiance and atmosphere throughout my home. This one adds moisture to dry air as well, which is especially great during the winter months. This diffuser would make a lovely gift."

Though the HK250 is capable of streaming media audio, I'm not impressed by its music acoustic qualities; the feature ranks as mere gimmick on monaural devices, though I applaud the Bluetooth specification which enables it since, being a speaker it may as well play back media audio - it's convenient.<br /><br />My favorite thing about the HK250 is the spoken audible cues; connection status, battery level, the phone number of the incoming calls and a subtle ""double-blip"" which indicates when the call recipient picks up the line.<br /><br />The finish is unappealing. I thought there was a thin, transparent piece of protective plastic to peel off the surface, but there's not. The plastic face readily shows finger smudges.<br /><br />Overall, this is fine for smaller ears. It has exceptional voice quality for an earpiece at its price. It can pair up with multiple devices at the same time. The range is exceptional; the connection remains through several walls, from one side of the house to the backyard at the other end.

2127,__label2__,This headboard is very attractive and very well made!  Just what we were looking for and looks great with matching night tables!
2128,__label2__,"Great price $150 and super fast shipping.  This thing is big and wicked cool.  My kid climbs all over it.  It does feel a little unstable at the top.  It says it can handle up to 150 lbs. but I wouldn't want to test that claim.  If you set it up outside, be sure to buy some anchors for it because it is not real heavy and a strong gust of wind will blow it over."

2130,__label2__,"I have filled these with hand cream for our long cold winter - perfect for an occupation that requires constant hand-washing and hand-sanitizing.<br /><br />Each little GoTubb holds plenty of hand cream for 2-3 weeks, and though each rattles around at the bottom of my small purse/large purse/knitting and book tote, the cover hasn't popped off. The design is really impressive - keeps the product fresh, the lid is very easy to open (but doesn't come off in your bag or pocket), and doesn't seem to gather bag-lint.<br /><br />Combine a set of these with a favorite hand cream, and you have a perfect gift!"
