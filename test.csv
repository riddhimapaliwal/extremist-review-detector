moderate,"[[VIDEOID:510ab4f85502b498e9e3ab1e9d04de8e]] The Eparé Double-Wall Insulated 9-ounce Whiskey Glass is a very classy set of two Whiskey Glasses.  The glasses are 9 ounce capacity.<br /><br />The glasses are made of borosilicate glass - a higher quality glass than what you find in normal glassware.  The glasses are lighter in weight, stronger and because they are double walled - insulated - they keep the drink colder longer and eliminate the condensation that so often forms on the outside of drinks.<br /><br />The glasses radiate class.  The Eparé name is etched on the bottom of each glass.<br /><br />The glasses are round, have a diameter of 3.5"" and a height of 3.5"".  They come as a set of two glasses in a very nice gift box set. The glasses were double wrapped with bubble wrap to prevent damage in transit.<br />These glasses will make a very fine addition to your bar ware.<br /><br />These are very classy glasses.  They should be reserved for special guest or special occasions.<br />I have found all Eparé  products to be well designed and well made.  Their products are targeted for the discriminating consumer.  These glasses would make an excellent gift and show your good taste.<br /><br />I was provided a set of glasses for testing/review purposes."

I've lost 8 lbs this month, which is WAY more than I've lost in a long time."

moderate,"before purchasing.  We've previously had Samsung and another Vizio sound bars (either sold or broken), but this one is so above and beyond those ones.  It's a bit pricier than the shorter models, so make sure you can justify your purchase before diving in."
